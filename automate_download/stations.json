		"LocationInfo": "The Igarka Geocryology Laboratory is situated in Igarka (67¬∞27‚Äô¬†N, 86¬∞32‚Äô E), on the right bank of the largest Russian river Yenisei, 120 km north of the Arctic Circle. Igarka belongs to the Turukhansk District (Krasnoyarsk Region), and it has 4892 inhabitants (2011).",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "Igarka is situated at the northwestern part of the Siberian platform, on the western edge of the Tunguska syneclise, one of the largest sedimentary basins of the world. The terrain is glacio-lacustrine plain, about 70 m above the low level of Yenisei River. It is shaped by a variety of permafrost processes, with thermokarst lakes, glacial processes, and pingos. The climate in Igarka is moderate continental, with low winter temperatures and relatively warm summers. The air temperatures are below zero for about 225 days per year, with an average of 70 rainy and 130 snowy days. The area is dominated by the Yenisei River with a mean annual discharge of about 18000 m3/s and a peak flow of about 160000 m3/s. The hydrological network is well developed with typical Western Siberian tundra rivers (Yenisei River left bank) and Eastern Siberian taiga rivers (Yenisei River right bank). Due to permafrost degradation, i.e. ground ice thawing, thermokarst lakes are widely distributed. The Northern taiga with relatively dense taiga forests (dominated by larch, fir, birch, and Siberian pine) is the common vegetation type. In the shrub layer, willow and alder are widespread, together with marsh tea and blueberries. Tundra communities dominate the watershed divides, widely represented by peatbogs covered with carex, cloudberries, cotton grass, and bog moss. The hydroclimatic conditions lead to the formation of different permafrost-affected gley soils.",
		"HistoryInfo": "Since the establishment in 1930, researchers of the Igarka Geo¬≠cryology Laboratory have conducted construction-engineering tests and regional permafrost studies. The research resulted in the development of new construction techniques in permafrost. Intensive studies regarding the physical and mechanical properties of frozen soils, permafrost processes, soil moisture migration in freeze-thaw cycles, and frost heave have been carried out. The use of novel engineering techniques in permafrost in the Soviet-era was strongly linked to the Igarka Research Station. Regional features were also extensively studied: Igarka was used as a ‚Äúbase camp‚Äù for field research in Western and Eastern Siberia, and northern and southern parts of the Krasnoyarsk Region. There is also the Museum of Permafrost (founded in 1965) with frozen tunnels more then 5 m below the surface. ",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Nowadays the laboratory is continuing the research in regional and engineering geocryology. Current projects include long-term monitoring of ground ice from the Arctic Circle to Norilsk, a 100 √ó 100 m grid of the CALM project (Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring), geothermal measurements in a network of boreholes, studies of permafrost processes, permafrost hydrology, water turbidity, and sediment-flux. Methods of construction on high-temperature, ice-rich permafrost and the development of new foundation types are the main engineering research aspects.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "The Igarka Geocyrology Labaratory is situated in the town of Igarka. Until the early 1990s the Igarka Timber Factory was the key economic activity in the area, but after the prohibition of lumber floating down the river, the factory was closed, thus undermining the city‚Äôs economy. Current economy is mainly determined by the river and sea ports, the modern airport, and the service departments of ‚ÄúVankoroil‚Äù, the Vankor Oil Field operator (the oil field is located about 130 km west of Igarka). ",
		"AccessInfo": "Igarka can be reached by air and water transport. Igarka Airport has a modern infrastructure and accepts all major aircraft and helicopter types. Flights are performed to Krasnoyarsk and Surgut. Water transport connects Igarka with Dudinka and Norilsk (including Alykel Airport) to the north, and Krasnoyarsk to the south, from early June to early October twice a week. Helicopter lease is available.",

		"LocationInfo": "ALPFOR is situated close to the summit of the Furka Pass at an elevation of 2435 m a.s.l. in the Swiss Central Alps, canton Uri (46¬∞34‚Äô N, 8¬∞25‚Äô E). The nearest larger community is Andermatt at the Gotthard Pass Road to Italy with approximately 1300 inhabitants. Land owner is the Korporation Ursern (a regional authority).",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "ALPFOR is placed in a small zone of mesozoic calcareous layers (‚ÄòUrsernzone‚Äô) within the granitic, gneissic, and phyllitic (mica schist) core of the central Alps. The pass itself and the summits around, with elevations above 3500 m a.s.l., form the watershed of three major European river systems (Rhone, Rhine, and Po). All glaciers around the Furka Pass are at a rapid retreat, accompanied by permafrost thawing, rock glacier melting, and the release of new terrain from ice. Floristically, the Furka Pass is one of the richest parts of the Alps, i.e. within 1 km around the ALPFOR station, the alpine flora comprises close to 300 species of flowering plants, which is more than half of the total Swiss alpine flora. This biological richness is explained by the local geology and the topographic diversity. By area, the two largest habitats are alpine grassland dominated by Carex curvula and open fell field/rock vegetation. There are wet and very dry microhabitats (cotton grass - Eriophorum sp, and succulents ‚Äì Sempervivum sp). ",
		"HistoryInfo": "ALPFOR adopted three buildings from the former military station in 2008-2011. House Carex (a former health station) is mainly used by permanent staff. It offers beds for 12 people in two storeys. House Rumex (also two-storey) has a small lecture room for 25 people, a ‚ÄòFlora galery‚Äô and a little tea-kitchen in the basement, and a 10-bed dormitory in the upper floor. House Ibex (former canteen and accommodation for officers) is a three-storey building with a large kitchen, a dining hall/lecture room for up to 100 people, and eight rooms with 2-4 beds. Several working rooms and modern sanitary facilities are offered in all three houses. ALPFOR can host up to 30 visitors at a time. ",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "The Furka Pass is an ideal region for alpine research. Since 1991, diverse studies have strongly shaped our understanding of the alpine ecosystem, which contributed to ‚ÄòAlpine Plant Life‚Äô (Ch. K√∂rner, Springer Publishers, 2003). Major research projects at ALPFOR deal with the influence of elevated CO2 concentration on growth, productivity, and water relations of alpine grassland and glacier forefield vegetation; the impact of nitrogen deposition, climatic warming, and sheep trampling on alpine grassland; microclimatology of alpine vegetation; population biology and reproductive ecology of alpine plants; molecular genetics of alpine plant populations (gene-ecology); hydrological consequences of land use change. For an overview on these research projects see: http://pages.unibas.ch/botschoen/alpfor/research.shtml. We offer alpine ecology summer courses to undergraduate and graduate students. Our students prepare for the summer school through a web-based teaching tool (English and Spanish version) that is freely offered to all users (www.alpandino.org). ",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "The major human influence in this area is pastoralism, which have existed here for more than a thousand years and is currently in rapid decline at lower elevations (with massive Alnus shrub encroachment). Higher elevations are facing uncontrolled increases in the number of sheep, leading to an intensification of grazing on the remaining, easily accessible parcels. The Alnus problem is the most immediate threat, because it leads to soil acidification, nitrogen eutrophication, plant diversity decline and it prevents natural reforestation by indigenous species (pristine forest was cleared already in the 11th century).",
		"AccessInfo": "The Furka Pass Road is open from May to October. The station is open from the 1st of June to the 30th September. There is a postbus service from Andermatt and Oberwald twice a day from each side of the pass. Andermatt and Oberwald have train stations less than 15 km away from the Furka pass. The link to the main Swiss rail system is at G√∂schenen. A trip from Basel or Zurich takes approximately three hours. ",

		"LocationInfo": "The Arctic Station is located on the south coast of the Disko Island in central West Greenland (69¬∞15‚Äô N, 53¬∞34‚Äô W). It is facing the Disko Bay/Davis Strait and is characterised by a low arctic, coastal climate. Some of the world‚Äôs largest icebergs drift by the Arctic Station .",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "The surroundings of Arctic Station are characterised by a large variety in landscape, flora, and fauna. The station and the nearby town Qeqertarsuaq are situated on a ridge of Precambrian gneisses overlain by massive basalts from the Tertiary. The surrounding mountains have an altitude of 600-800 m a.s.l. Three major valley glaciers, Lyngmarksbr√¶en, Chamberlain‚Äôs Glacier, and Petersen‚Äôs Glacier, can be visited on a single day trip. The area around Qeqertarsuaq is situated in the transition zone between continuous and discontinuous permafrost. A large variety of periglacial phenomena can be studied, i.e. ice- and sand wedges, stone polygons, mud circles, as well as palsa and pingo formations. The coastline is situated only 300 m south of the station along a 100 m wide sandy coastal barrier. The vegetation within the immediate surroundings of the Arctic Station is unique to low arctic Greenland. This is illustrated by the number of species of flowering plants within walking distance from the station: 212 of the 513 Greenlandic flower species occur in the area. This plant diversity is caused by a relatively favourable local climate, a high altitudinal gradient, rich soils, and several homothermic springs.",
		"HistoryInfo": "The botanist Morten Petersen Porsild founded the Arctic Station (‚ÄúDen Danske Arktiske Station‚Äù) in 1906. The locality selected was c. 1 km east of the town Qeqertarsuaq (formerly Godhavn) which is located on the south coast of the Disko Island ‚Äì also named Qeqertarsuaq. The idea of establishing an arctic research facility in Greenland was supported by famous explorers of the northern polar regions, e.g. Knud Rasmussen, Ludwig Mylius-Erichsen, and Fridtjof Nansen. The University of Copenhagen became the owner of the research facility in 1953. Arctic Station has around 150 Danish and international visitors, students, and researchers each year. Arctic Station has rooms for 26 people. Kitchen, living room, seminar room, scientific library, and laboratories are found at the station.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "The surroundings of Arctic Station offer both terrestrial and marine environments, which makes the research station ideal for botanists, zoologists, geologists, geophysicists, and physical geographers. A meteorological station was established in 1990, and a full record of climate data exists since 1991. These monitoring data are available through Dr. Birger Ulf Hansen, University of Copenhagen, Institute for Geology and Geography (buh@ign.ku.dk).",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "Arctic Station is located only 1 km east of the town Qeqertarsuaq (Godhavn) with a population of around 1000 inhabitants. The city was established in 1773 by Sven Sandgren. Whaling has always been very important for the city. Fishing and hunting are still among the primary occupations for the island‚Äôs inhabitants. Tourism is another major business. As something quite unique for Greenland, it is possible to ride a dog sledge on the local glaciers at Qeqertarsuaq under the midnight sun during summer. One can hike to the top of the Lyngmarksfjeld where efforts are rewarded by a fantastic view of Disko Bay and the gigantic icebergs at Ilulissat Icefjord almost 100 kilometres away.",
		"AccessInfo": "The Arctic Station can be visited without problems throughout the year. Qeqertarsuaq Heliport is served in winter by the Bell 212 helicopter. Air Greenland operates winter-only air services from Qeqertarsuaq Heliport to Ilulissat, Qasigiannguit, and Aasiaat. During summer and autumn, when the waters of Disko Bay are ice-free, transport between towns and settlements is by sea only. A ferry (Diskoline) links Qeqertarsuaq with Ilulissat, Aasiaat, and Qasigiannguit. For further information see www.diskoline.gl. ",

		"LocationInfo": "Avachinsky Volcano Field Station is located in the Russian Far East, on the southern part of the Kamchatka peninsula, near the main cities of the region, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy and Yelizovo. The field station is situated at an altitude of about 950 m a.s.l. on a saddle between Koryaksky and Avachinsky volcanoes (53¬∞15‚Äô N, 158¬∞44‚Äô E). The station is located in the Nalychevo Nature Park. The main landscape feature near the station is the valley of the Sukhaya Elizovskaya River, which drains the slopes of the volcanoes in the region. ",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "The surroundings of the field station are characterised by a large variety in landscape, flora, and fauna. The station itself is located in a shrub tundra zone, and the surroundings include altitudinal zonation from forest to glaciers. Both volcanoes near the station are occasionally active ‚Äì Avachinsky‚Äôs last eruption occurred in 2001, and now the crater is covered by a lava neck with a heavy fumarole activity underneath. Koryaksky volcano is dormant, but in 1956 and 2008 it erupted with ash plumes and a pyroclastic flow. The area features pyroclastic slopes, where outcrops carved by rivers expose stratified lapilli tuffs, deep gullies, and a few small fumaroles. The fauna and vegetation within the surroundings of the station is typical for the Kamchatka peninsula, and one of the main species around the station is the arctic ground squirrel. Occasionally, bears, sable, and lynx visit the area. Different kinds of salmonid fish spawn in the rivers of the Nalychevo valley. ",
		"HistoryInfo": "Nalychevo Nature Park is part of the biggest protected area of the Kamchatka peninsula ‚Äì the nature park ‚ÄúVolcanoes of Kamchatka‚Äù. The nature park was established in 1995 and became part of the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1996. The station can accommodate 24 people, and has kitchen and living room. Tenting is allowed both at the station and within the study area.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "The research at Avachinsky Volcano Field Station focuses on the botany, the ecology, and the zoology of the volcanic tundra zone. Recently, investigations of hydrology, hydrogeology, glaciology, meteorology, geomorphology, and soil science were initiated. Since no long-term hydrological data are available for the rivers draining the volcanoes, the main purpose of the recently initiated studies is field-based assessments of water and sediment discharges within the study river. The station maintains databases containing records on plants, biota, and vegetation-cover ecology. Databases on hydrology and climate are being developed.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "Avachinsky Volcano Research Station is the gate to the Nalychevo river valley, which is a protected area with different points of interest for all kinds of tourism. The status of the area as a national park protect it from industrial development and uncontrolled visits, but the abundance of fish in the rivers and proximity to the region‚Äôs capital also attract poachers.",
		"AccessInfo": "The research station can be reached by four-wheel drive vehicles from the nearby cities Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy and Elizovo (60 and 30 km away, respectively).

		"LocationInfo": "Barrow (c. 4000 inhabitants) is located at the northern tip of Alaska (USA) on the Arctic Coastal Plain north of the Brooks Range Mountains, at the junction of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. The adjacent Barrow Environmental Observatory comprises 30.21 km2 of tundra, lakes, and wetlands reserved for scientific research including long-term environmental monitoring and habitat manipulation experiments.",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "Barrow is characterised by a polar maritime climate but is semi-arid (c. 150 mm annual precipitation). It lies north of the tree-line so the dominant vegetation types are grass, moss, and sedge. Virtually all land in the area is underlain by permafrost within a few meters of the surface. The landscape is characterised by thermokarst lakes and drained lake basins undergoing plant succession. Polar bears and Arctic foxes are found in the region. A large number of transient bird species migrate to the North Slope during the summer including snowy owl, tundra swan, snow bunting, and various species of geese and ducks, including the endangered Steller‚Äôs and spectacled eiders. Caribou are frequently observed in the area. During the spring, bowhead whales migrate close to shore, and both gray and beluga whales are often sighted during the summer.",
		"HistoryInfo": "Barrow has a long research history starting with the establishment of an observation station during the First International Polar Year (1882-1883) ‚Äì hosting near-continuous measurements since then. The Arctic Research Laboratory was established in 1947 and has supported a vast number of atmospheric, biological, oceanic, and terrestrial research activities. Present facilities include modern laboratories, storage, internet access, local accommodations, and cafeteria or self catering facilities. Vehicle support can also be arranged. Restaurants, supplies, and a grocery store are available in town. Several other programs funded through the US government maintain additional facilities in Barrow including the National Weather Service and Earth System Research Laboratory (both part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin.), Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Climate Research Facility (Dept. of Energy), and the US Fish and Wildlife Service (Dept. of Interior). Additionally, the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management is based in Barrow.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Approximately 50 individual research projects are supported annually. Much of the work at Barrow involves atmospheric chemistry, ecosystem dynamics, plant/animal phenology studies, and Climate Change monitoring. Many sea ice studies are also based in the area. Limnological and large animal physiology projects are occasionally undertaken. ",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "Barrow has been occupied by humans for at least 1200 years, and a strong I√±upiaq culture is still practiced today including subsistence hunting and whaling activities. English is the predominant language but many residents speak I√±upiaq. The village is the political, logistical, and administrative hub of the 245000 km2 North Slope Borough, and as a result most modern conveniences are available. Summer tourism is an important part of the economy, and nearby resource extraction is becoming more prevalent. Several mobile phone carriers provide reliable service. Off-road access to the tundra (i.e. for hiking) requires a local land use permit. There are several gymnasiums open to the public and Barrow High School provides opportunities for spectator sports. Ilisavik College provides continuing education and vocational training to students throughout the region.",
		"AccessInfo": "There is no road access to Barrow, but the town is serviced by commercial airlines (Alaska Airlines, Era Alaska) with multiple daily flights, year-round. Both fixed-wing aircrafts and helicopters can be chartered for research activities from vendors based in Fairbanks (800 km away) or Anchorage (1200 km away) and staged from the Barrow Airport. Additionally, Northern Air Cargo provides commercial shipping services and the US Postal Service delivers mail and small packages daily. There is no port facility, but resupply barges and boat access are available during the summer. Research facilities are located approximately 5 km north of the village and can be reached via the local road system.",

Bioforsk Svanhovd is situated in Svanvik, a small village in the Pasvik Valley. It is located at the western shore of the Pasvik River that originates from the huge Lake Inari in Finland and flows northwards into the Barents Sea and defines the border between Norway and Russia.",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "The surroundings in the Pasvik Valley are part of the western distribution limit of the Russian taiga and the fauna and flora has a strong eastern influence, with many species not found in other areas of Europe, e.g. interesting aquatic flora. The area includes old-growth pine forest, wetlands, lakes, rivers, mountain birch forest, tundra, seashore, and fjords. Most groups of organisms in the area are poorly studied with many still unknown species in certain taxa. The area is also found to be the northernmost distribution of several species and the Pasvik River has a very high biological diversity compared to other rivers in Norway. The area is exposed to several invading species.",
		"HistoryInfo": "Svanhovd was established in 1934 as a governmental demonstration farm to provide expertise and aid to the settlers of the Pasvik Valley. In the early 1990s, a change of activity towards environmental research was motivated in particular due to large emissions from the metal smelters in the Russian city Nikel (9¬†km away from Svanhovd). 2001, a visitor centre for the √òvre Pasvik National Park was established and, in 2006, Svanhovd Environmental Centre became a part of the Norwegian Institute for Agricultural and Environmental Research. The laboratory at Bioforsk Svanhovd has facilities for microbiological, chemical-physical, and DNA-analysis. It is accredited for DNA analyses of brown bears. Bioforsk Svanhovd has a conference centre with accommodation for 50 persons (in single and double rooms, with private bathrooms). Guests are free to use Svanhovds fireplace, TV lounge, sauna, and laundry room. The conference centre offers an auditorium for 80 persons, and smaller meeting rooms for 5 to 30 persons. Additional accommodation can be arranged in Svanvik (walking distance) and at hotels in Kirkenes (45 minutes by car).",

		"LocationInfo": "The ECN Cairngorms site is a north facing granite catchment overlain with peat situated in the Cairngorms Mountains of Scotland (57¬∞07‚Äô N, 03¬∞49‚Äô W), rising from about 350 m a.s.l. through the tree line at 500 m a.s.l. to the highest summit at 1111 m a.s.l. The catchment area is 10 km2. The site is part of the Invereshie and Inshriach National Nature ¬≠Reserve, and forms part of the Cairngorms National Park. ",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "The catchment is composed of a wide range of ecosystems from pine forest at low altitude, through bog communities on ground with impeded drainage, to alpine vegetation including moss and lichen heaths on the highest ground. The charismatic capercaillie, a member of the grouse family (IUCN Red listed), is found in the pine woods along with pine martin. Several species of deer can be found grazing a variety of habitats from the forests to the summits. The site has virtually no natural tree line due to past overgrazing but is now being extensively re-colonised by Pinus sylvestris. ",
		"HistoryInfo": "From the middle of the nineteenth century the site was mainly used as deer forest, as part of a large sporting estate in private ownership (Invereshie Estate). It became part of the Cairngorms National Nature Reserve in 1954. Ecological and environmental research has been undertaken in the area since the early 1960s, and the site joined the Environmental Change Network of the UK in 1998. There are no buildings on the site, but accommodation for a small number of visitors can be arranged on site (camping), and there are local hotels and guest houses nearby. ",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Research on the site includes both terrestrial and freshwater environmental monitoring as part of the ECN and also as part of the Austrian GLORIA programme (www.gloria.ac.at), examining temperature effects on vegetation across Alpine Europe. Intensive hydrological and snow related research took place in the early 1990s. The Cairngorms area has been the focus of many land use change and tourism impact studies since c. the 1980s, and the data is being used in current ecosystem service research. ",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "The research site is uninhabited and used for recreation; hiking, trekking, and mountain biking. Aviemore, the nearest town, has a population of around 2500 and became one of the first skiing resorts to be established in Scotland with the opening of the chairlift in 1961. The resort has since grown into the UK‚Äôs most visited ski resort during the winter months. In 2013 the national park became the first Long-Term Social-Ecological Research (LTSER) platform in the UK, providing a platform for linking ecological, social and economic research.",
		"AccessInfo": "The research site is close to Aviemore, which has good rail and bus services to Edinburgh (approximately 3 hours) and Inverness (less than an hour). A full suite of laboratory facilities are available at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Edinburgh (CEH) located 10 km south of Edinburgh.",

		"LocationInfo": "The Canadian High Arctic Research Station (CHARS) is located in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut. The Kitikmeot hamlet‚Äôs central northern location provides good access to all parts of the Canadian Arctic. The main campus for CHARS is located on the Plateau site in Cambridge Bay, on a slope overlooking the community and the bay. The site is close to other major infrastructure, including the community core.",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "The climate in the Cambridge Bay area is characterised by a high degree of continentality, demonstrated by a large mean annual temperature range (range of ~45¬∞C) and some of the lowest annual precipitation amounts (100‚Äì150 mm) encountered in the Canadian Arctic Islands. The annual mean temperature in Cambridge Bay increased by 1.1¬∞C (1961-2010), with most of the warming occurring during the winter months. The bedrock in the Cambridge Bay region and southeastern Victoria Island is Cambrian limestone, and the region hosts a wide range of peri¬≠glacial landforms, e.g. patterned grounds, solifluction lobes, and thermokarst lakes. Permafrost is nearly continuous, with active layers during summer being <1 m. Bioclimatically, the region is part of the Low Arctic, characterised by a moist tundra with low shrubs, forbs, grasses, and cryptogams. The vascular flora consists of c. 150 plant species. The arthropod fauna around Cambridge Bay is relatively diverse and consists of hundreds of insect and spider species. Cambridge Bay is an important fishing area for arctic char and lake trout, and has a small commercial fishery. Southern Victoria Island is an important staging and nesting area for many migratory birds, particularly waders (shorebirds). It also has sizeable populations of caribou, muskox, arctic hare, arctic fox, and arctic wolf.",
		"HistoryInfo": "CHARS was first announced in 2007. Construction of the infrastructure began in 2014 and the station will be operational in time for the 150th anniversary of the Confederation in 2017. It will establish a world-class hub for science and technology in Canada‚Äôs North that connects a network of regional facilities. The Station will provide a suite of services for Science and Technology (S&T) in Canada‚Äôs North, including a technology development centre, knowledge sharing centre, and advanced laboratories. The S&T Program will ensure the new infrastructure supports the planned S&T activities. A five-year planning cycle, starting in 2014, was selected to drive the S&T Program to concrete, measurable results, and to address national priorities.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "The first 5-year Science and Technology Plan will be phased-in beginning in 2014-2015. This Plan outlines the following shortterm priorities: (i) information preparedness for development; (ii) alternative and renewable energy; (iii) underwater situational awareness; (iv) predicting the impacts of changing ice, permafrost, and snow on shipping, infrastructure, and communities, and (v) infrastructure for development.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "Cambridge Bay (Iqaluktuttiaq in Inuinnaqtun, meaning ‚Äúgood fishing place‚Äù) is a hamlet located on Victoria Island in the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut, Canada. The hamlet has a population of c. 1600 people of which about 80% are Inuit. The community is the largest stop for passenger and research vessels traversing the Arctic Ocean‚Äôs Northwest Passage. Situated between Dease Strait and Queen Maud Gulf on the southeast coast of Victoria Island, part of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Cambridge Bay is a transportation and administrative centre for the Kitikmeot Region. The area was a traditional hunting and fishing location and archaeological sites are often found. Barrenground caribou, muskox, arctic char, lake trout, and ringed seal were and remain important primary food sources.",
		"AccessInfo": "The only passenger services are through the Cambridge Bay Airport with daily air service to Yellowknife, and to the other Kitikmeot Region communities. Although Cambridge Bay lies on the Northwest Passage there are no passenger ships other than tourist cruises and annual sealift to the community. Charter and MEDIVAC (air ambulance) services are available.",

		"BiodiversityInfo": "The landscape around the station is composed of both wooded hills (30 %) and hills dominated by tundra vegetation (70 %). The most protected sites are generally forested except for areas that have been affected by fire and consequently induced an opening in the forest cover. Landscape features of scientific interest are discontinuous permafrost, thermokarst ponds, palsas, the Boniface River, and the treeline.",
		"HistoryInfo": "The CEN Boniface River Field Station was constructed in 1985 by Professor Serge Payette to conduct research on past treeline and tree growth dynamics in the context of Climate Change. It was upgraded in 2010. Presently, the station is comprised of three individual buildings (one with a shower) that serve primarily as laboratories and a kitchen building. These are powered by solar energy and heated with an oil furnace. Onsite there are two zodiac-style boats. Access to the different research sites is primarily by helicopter or by the Boniface River, which is navigable for some 20 km. Dormitory tents and sleeping bags for researchers and students can be provided by the CEN. Typically, between five and twenty people can be found at the research station during the summer season. ",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Meteorological stations installed within the proximity of the research station have been recording the prevailing conditions at the tree limit, including the thermal contrast (air and soil) between tundra and forest environments, since 1988. In addition, tree growth has been measured with the aid of a dozen electronic dendrometers since the summer of 2005. Data available through Nordicana D: www.cen.ulaval.ca/nordicanad/. Topics which are studied at the station include the following, but are not exclusive to these: Vegetation dynamics of a subarctic topo-sequence and the interaction between climate and forest fires, genetic homogeneity in the ecological heterogeneity of Qu√©bec subarctic forests in relation to climatic change, black spruce growth as an indicator of Climate Change at the treeline in northern Quebec, origin and dynamics of wooded palsas in the Boniface River region, dwarf birch (Betula glandulosa) densification since 1950, the influence of permafrost on riverine ecosystem dynamics, fire history of the Boniface River region, long black spruce tree-ring chronology, riparian ecosystem dynamics, Holocene evolution of a palsa plateau at the tree limit, and structural dynamics of an ancient spruce lichen woodland at the northern forest limit.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "No communities live at or near Boniface River Field Station. The nearest community is Inukjuak more than 120 km away and on the shores of eastern Hudson Bay.",
		"AccessInfo": "Beginning in the summer of 2001, supplies for the research station have been delivered primarily by fixed winged aircraft, i.e. Twin Otter, thanks to the construction of a 300 m long airstrip situated on the opposite shore of the research station. Access to the station is by chartered helicopter or Twin Otter, departing from Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik. ",

		"LocationInfo": "Bylot Island is located off the northern tip of Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada. It is accessible through the communities of Pond Inlet (Mittimatalik) and Nanisivik, both found on Northern Baffin Island. The field research covers the south plain of the island (1600 km2), but the research station is located in a large glacial valley at the southwest end of the island (73¬∞08‚Äô N, 80¬∞00‚Äô W). ",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "Much of Bylot Island is covered by high mountain peaks and glaciers. The remainder of Bylot Island, and in particular its southern plain, is characterised by extensive low-elevation areas covered by heterogeneous tundra vegetation. The vegetation found in the wetlands is characterised by the presence of sedges, grasses, and many brown moss species. In contrast to the wetlands, dryer areas are found on slopes, hills and elevated terraces surrounding the valley lowlands, as well as on the rims surrounding tundra polygons. The better drained, dryer soils of these habitats allows for distinct plant communities, including forbs, grasses, and shrubs. These uplands, account for 90% of the south plain surface whereas wetlands account for only 10%. The wetlands of the south plain are a habitat of rare plant quality and productivity for an arctic environment. Benefiting from this ‚Äúpolar oasis‚Äù are more than 360 species of plants, 10 mammal species, and 74 bird species. Considered as an important site for many migratory birds, Bylot Island was declared a Migratory Bird Sanctuary in 1965. The south plain holds one of the world‚Äôs largest breeding colonies of greater snow geese and the wetlands of the Qarlikturvik valley represent their main brood-rearing site on the island. In addition to the geese, other herbivores are the brown and collared lemmings, Arctic hare, caribou, and rock ptarmigan. The main terrestrial predators are the Arctic fox, long-tailed jaeger, parasitic jaeger, glaucous gull, common raven, and snowy owl. Food web relationships are summarised in Gauthier et al. (2011): Ecoscience 18: 223-235.",
		"HistoryInfo": "The current ecological studies on Bylot Island started in 1988 as a joint collaboration between Universit√© Laval (CEN) and the Canadian Wildlife Service (Quebec region). The initial goals of the study were to initiate a demographic study of the greater snow geese population through a long-term marking program, and to assess the impact of goose grazing on the tundra vegetation. However, over the years, the research program has broadened considerably and now includes many other components of the terrestrial ecosystem. ",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "A central theme of the research conducted here is trophic interactions in the arctic tundra in relation to environmental changes and greater snow goose ecology, but also long-term monitoring of animal populations, vegetation and climate of the Arctic tundra, impacts of bird populations and Climate Change on lake ecosystems, and geomorphology of ice wedge polygons. Over the years, the Bylot Island research project has grown into one of the largest and longest ecological studies in Nunavut. Established in 2001, Sirmilik National Park encompasses most of Bylot Island, except for a few pockets that are Inuit-owned lands. Covering an area of 22000 km2, this park extends to the northern part of Baffin Island. Sirmilik (which means ‚Äúplace of glaciers‚Äù in Inuktitut) reflects the complex of glaciers and ice caps covering most of Bylot Island. Extensive climate data records are available upon request. For requests concerning ecological monitoring data, please contact the lead researcher Gilles Gauthier (gilles.gauthier@bio.ulaval.ca).",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "No communities are present on Bylot Island. The nearest community is Pond Inlet (Mittimatalik) found on northern Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada. ",
		"AccessInfo": "The research station is accessible by chartered flights from Pond Inlet (Mittimatalik). Research must be planned well in advance and coordinated with the station‚Äôs primary and secondary contacts Gilles Gauthier and Dominique Berteaux (dominique_berteaux@uqar.qc.ca). ",

		"BiodiversityInfo": "Clearwater Lake is the second largest natural lake of the province of Qu√©bec (2243 km2). It sits at an altitude of 240 m, the limit reached by the postglacial sea, and drains into Hudson Bay via Clearwater River (Rivi√®re √† l‚Äô Eau-Claire) with a maximum outflow rate of 150 m3/s. The lake features two adjacent, circular basins (26 and 36 km in diameter) that were created by a meteoritic impact about 290 ¬± 20 million years ago (Permian Age). Even though vascular plant diversity is low on regional granite gneisses, the volcanic breccias (clastic-textured extrusive igneous rocks) situated on the islands of the western basin (11 islands forming a circle) are populated by 250 vascular species, 15% of which are specific to the shores. Avifauna is abundant and the islands constitute an enclave for shrub tundra in an area that is rather characterised by forest tundra.",
		"HistoryInfo": "CEN research has been conducted here since 1980, but the station buildings are recent, built in 2000 and upgraded in 2011. The buildings were originally built by outfitters but have been considerably upgraded by the CEN. The three buildings can accommodate nine people. They are equipped with solar-powered electricity, running water, dry toilettes, and oil heating. The station is accessible from June to October by float plane or helicopter. About 10 km to the southeast, there is a natural airstrip maintained by Air Inuit. However, a river separates the station from the airstrip.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Past research has focused on regional ecosystem dynamics, specifically on the response of the forest to disturbances such as fire and insect outbreaks, dendrochronology, riparian vegetation and biodiversity, periglacial processes, secular variations in water levels, and hydrology. Other research topics have covered limnology of the two basins, geological and geomorphological history, and biophysical features of the area. Wildlife studies (birds, caribou, small mammals, fish, and biting insects) have also been conducted, as well as archeological studies (recently). CEN operates three climate stations in and around the western basin of the lake, one of which is on a small island directly in the centre of the basin. In addition to scientific literature, CEN has extensive climate data since 1986 which are available through Nordicana D: www.cen.ulaval.ca/nordicanad/.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "Clearwater Lake is situated within the boundaries of a provincial park and on aboriginal land. First Nations people, the Cree, still use the land extensively for hunting and fishing, especially during spring and autumn. There are no permanent settlements around the station, the closest village Umiujaq is about 135 km west on the shores of Hudson Bay. Access to the station is organised by CEN from the Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik Research Station. ",

		"BiodiversityInfo": "Radisson is surrounded by the eastern Canadian Shield taiga with Boreal forest that is dominated by black spruce and grey pine. The region is relatively poor in terms of plant species diversity with a count of about 350 vascular plant species, yet the diversity in wildlife is rich with forty mammal and sixty bird species. Forest fires are a very dynamic element of the region, sculpting the landscape into natural mosaics nested between rocky hills which confine the lower wetlands (mainly lakes and bogs). Radisson is situated in a postglacial marine invasion with limited drainage due to the presence of clay in the lowlands. From 1989 to 1996, fires within the town of Radisson considerably changed the landscape. The region has been studied and monitored extensively since 1974 in the context of the development of the hydroelectric complex. Consequently, Hydro-Qu√©bec and the Soci√©t√© d‚Äô√©nergie de la baie de James have produced several syntheses on the area.",
		"HistoryInfo": "Researchers from the CEN have been working in this region since 1994, but the station was established in 1999 and was upgraded in 2010. The facility consists of three houses (3 bedrooms each), with a total capacity for 25 people, a laboratory building with a chemical hut, a meeting room, and a workshop. ",

		"LocationInfo": "The station is situated in the Inuit community of Salluit, Nunavik, Qu√©bec, Canada (62¬∞12‚Äô N, 75¬∞38‚Äô W).",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "Salluit is located in the low arctic tundra in the continuous permafrost zone. The hilly bedrock consists principally of gneissic rocks from the Precambrian belonging to the Canadian Shield. The village is located in a valley that opens to the shore of Sugluk inlet (a fjord). The surrounding landscape consists of rocky plateaus with a hilly topography. The region was deglaciated about 8000 years ago and sectors below the elevation of 150 m were inundated by the post-glacial d‚ÄôIberville Sea. Till and some glacio-fluvial sediments are the major surficial materials on the plateaus, while the Salluit valley and the other valleys that connect with the fjord (particularly at the fjord head) are floored with fluvial sediments in terraces and marine clay. The geology and the oceanography of the fjord are poorly studied. The fjord opens to Hudson Strait. Mean annual air temperature is c. -8 ¬∞C and annual precipitation c. 300 mm (50 % snow).",
		"HistoryInfo": "Research has been conducted in the region in both natural and human sciences since the early 1960s by various groups. Permafrost research by the CEN began in 1987. In the context of Climate Change, a major research program was undertaken in 2002 to support community adaptation to changing permafrost and to assist the community in addressing housing and infrastructure needs for the rapidly growing population. The field station (a house) was built in 2010 thanks to a grant acquired from a federal research infrastructure program.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Numerous theses and research papers have been published on permafrost, periglacial geomorphology (ice-wedges, slope processes), archaeology, climatology, paleo-climate (paleo-soils and lake cores), population, culture, and land management in the area. Climate and permafrost temperature data from automatic stations, in operation since August 2002, are available upon request at cen@cen.ulaval.ca. Data available through Nordicana¬†D: www.cen.ulaval.ca/nordicanad/.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "Inuit and their ancestors have occupied the region for over 3500 years. Many of the key archaeological sites of the Hudson Strait region are along the fjord coastline and along Hudson Strait. The shift from a nomadic lifestyle to permanent settlement led to the growth of the village in the 1930s with the installation of the Hudson Bay Company and churches. The population size has reached about 1350 inhabitants, with youths constituting an important part of the population. ",
		"AccessInfo": "Access is by commercial airlines from Montr√©al and Qu√©bec city. Every summer, several cargo ships allow shipping of heavy equipment and materials, though this requires planning in advance. The station has no permanent staff. Local support for services and field work is available in the community. Station ¬≠users are instructed to do their cleaning and take good care of the premises and do minimal maintenance, if needed.

		"LocationInfo": "The station is in the village of Umiujaq, situated on the shores of the eastern Hudson Bay in Nunavik, Qu√©bec, Canada (56¬∞33‚Äô N, 76¬∞32‚Äô W). ",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "The village is located 15 km north of Richmond Gulf (Lac Guillaume-Delisle), an immense inland bay connected to the Hudson Bay via a rocky gulch resembling a canyon. The many rivers flowing into the Gulf make its waters brackish and rich in brook trout, whitefish, seal, and beluga. The sheltered maritime environment features sporadic black spruce and larch, but the surrounding area is rather characterised by shrub tundra, discontinuous permafrost (mostly palsa bogs), and thermokarst lakes. In front of the village are the Nastapoka Islands (cuestas) where many species of birds, such as common loons, eider ducks, and peregrine falcons, find summer shelter and nest. The steep cliffs plunge into the Nastapoka Sound with waters up to 110 m deep. About 30¬†km north of Umiujaq is the Nastapoka River with its scenic 30¬†m high falls. The river estuary is extraordinarily rich and diverse with landlocked freshwater seals, salmon, and many fish species. Access to the Tursujuq Provincial Park, as well as to the marine/coastal-, river-, lake-, mountainous-, deltaic-, and shrub tundra environments, and the migrating treeline, is from Umiujaq.",
		"HistoryInfo": "Umiujaq was established in 1986 by Inuit from Kuujjuarapik, 160¬†km to the south, who decided to relocate in the region where they hoped to better preserve their traditional lifestyle in an area where fish and game were not threatened by development. CEN‚Äôs research has been conducted here since 1980. In previous years, CEN researchers used a meat plant/warehouse that has shared ownership (CEN, Anniturvik Landholding Corporation, and Makivik Corporation). In 2010, CEN undertook major station upgrades and restored the warehouse (still shared with its partners), built a vehicle garage, and a three-bedroom house. The facility is next to a pier for easy maritime access and can accommodate seven to eight people at a time. The house is equipped with partial solar powered electricity, running water (kitchen, toilet, and laundry), and oil heating. ",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Past and present research has focused on permafrost studies, coastal geology, and geomorphological characterisation of the region. Other research topics cover biodiversity and dynamics of northern aquatic ecosystems, impacts of thawing permafrost in the context of global warming, wetlands paleoecology, research on mercury dynamics (air, precipitation, snow), snow and ice dynamics, greenhouse gas emissions from thermokarst ponds and tundra, sea and lake bottom mapping, and plant community dynamics and response of northern plants to Climate Change. Archeological studies and community based monitoring activities have also taken place. CEN operates four climate stations in the area and thermistor cables are installed to monitor permafrost temperature. CEN has extensive climate data since 1997 which are available through Nordicana D: www.cen.ulaval.ca/nordicanad/.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "Umiujaq has a population of about 500 inhabitants, mainly Inuit. The people speak Inuktitut and English with some French. Some research on the social dimensions has been conducted over time. ",
		"AccessInfo": "Umiujaq is only accessible by commercial airlines. All research activities must be planned in advance. Maritime transport is available twice a year. Local guides and translators are available for hire. Access to the surrounding area by chartered flights (floatplane and helicopter) can be organized by CEN from the Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik Research Station.

		"LocationInfo": "Ward Hunt Island is located at the northernmost tip of Canada, off the coast of northern Ellesmere Island and is part of Quttinirpaaq National Park, Nunavut, Canada (83¬∞06‚Äô N, 74¬∞10‚Äô W). Quttinirpaaq means ‚Äútop of the world‚Äù in Inuktitut and reflects this station‚Äôs location, situated about 750 km from the North Pole. ",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "This island in the high arctic is 6.5 km long (from east to west) and 3.3 km wide. The climate regime is typical of polar deserts, with dry and extremely cold temperatures (annual mean temperature of -17.3¬∞C). The natural environment features lakes, ice shelves, fjords, epishelf lakes, ice caps and glaciers, sea ice, mountains, and valleys. The desert terrain has a low plant and animal diversity, but the region contains diverse microbial communities such as cyanobacterial mats that survive in these extreme environments. An overview of past studies in this region is given in: Vincent, W.F., et al. 2011: Extreme ecosystems and geosystems in the Canadian High Arctic: Ward Hunt Island and vicinity (Ecoscience 18: 236-261).",
		"HistoryInfo": "The first known sighting was in 1876 by Pelham Aldrich, a lieutenant with the George Nares expedition, and named for George Ward Hunt, First Lord of the Admiralty (1874-1877). Ward Hunt Island was briefly used as a weather station during the International Geophysical Year of 1957-58, and since then it has been used as the starting point for a number of attempts to reach the North Pole, beginning with Ralph Plaisted in 1968. Scientists have been working at the station since the 1950s. Parks Canada has three Weatherhaven shelters with oil burner furnaces, each can host 12 people for sleeping. CEN operates three automated, year-round climate stations of SILA Network in the region. A laboratory made of insulated fiberglass and powered by solar panels was built in 2010 thanks to a federal infrastructure grant.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Main research fields comprise the structure and functioning of lake and river ecosystems at high latitudes, dynamics of northern ice shelves, microbial ecology, geomorphology of polar desert landscapes, impacts of UV radiation, and Climate Change on aquatic ecosystems. Extensive climate data records are available on the Nordicana D: www.cen.ulaval.ca/nordicanad/. For requests concerning ecological monitoring data, please contact the leading researcher, Warwick Vincent (warwick.vincent@bio.ulaval.ca).",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "No communities live on Ward Hunt Island. The nearest community is Grise Fjord, located 800 km away on southern Ellesmere Island. Grise Fjord, (Inuktitut: Aujuittuq, ‚Äúplace that never thaws‚Äù; Inuktitut syllabics: ) is a small Inuit hamlet in the Qikiqtaaluk Region in the territory of Nunavut, Canada. With a population of 141 residents (as of the Canada 2006 Census), it is the only Inuit community on Ellesmere Island. It is also one of the coldest inhabited places in the world, with an average yearly temperature of -16.5¬∞C. Grise Fjord lies 1160 km north of the Arctic Circle in the Arctic Cordillera mountain range which is the only major mountain system east of the Canadian Rockies. The Canadian military base Alert is 170 km to the East and slightly to the South of Ward Hunt Island.",

		"LocationInfo": "The CEN Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik Research Station (55¬∞16‚Äô¬†N, 77¬∞45‚Äô W) is located on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay at the maritime limit of James Bay, and in the adjacent villages of Whapmagoostui (Cree First Nation) and Kuujjuarapik (Inuit). ",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "The climate at Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik is strongly influenced by the proximity of Hudson Bay, and the recent pronounced loss of sea ice in this sector of northern Canada has been accompanied by large increases in air temperature. Discontinuous or scattered permafrost occurs throughout the region and is degrading rapidly. Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik is located at the terrestrial boundary between taiga and tundra. South of the Great Whale River is the taiga zone (Boreal forest), while north of the river, the forest tundra zone progressively dominates the landscape. The vegetation type is coastal forest tundra, with some 400 recorded species. Parabolic dunes occur along the coast and are strongly influenced by plant cover. Paleoecological studies have documented the Holocene evolution of landscapes, including lakes, wetlands, and forests. The Manitounuk Islands, located just a little north along the coast, are part of the Hudsonian cuestas that are characterized by rocky beaches and vertiginous cliffs.",
		"HistoryInfo": "The first signs of human occupation in the Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik region have been dated at 3800 BP. In the past, the English name Great Whale and the French name Poste-de-la-¬≠Baleine have been used to designate this community. The ¬≠Hudson Bay Company (HBC) established the first fur trade post here in 1750 and marked the onset of continuous occupation. This station is the CEN‚Äôs principal field station and has operated since the 1970s, with diverse research projects on past and present environments. In 2010, major upgrades to the station were undertaken, consisting of the construction of a state-of-art Community Science Centre to serve the needs of the circumpolar science community for research planning, information exchange, national research workshops, and coordination of field operations, and the local communities for information exchange, identification of northern research needs, science training of northerners, exchange of traditional knowledge, and outreach activities. The centre offers a conference room with a capacity for 50 participants, a permanent, interactive display on local natural history and on CEN research activities. In addition to this new building, the station also has wet and dry laboratories, a greenhouse, a dormitory, a cafeteria (with full-meal services during the summer season), vehicles for rent, wireless internet, rental of sampling and camping equipment, and an onsite station manager. ",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Current projects include work on biodiversity and dynamics of northern aquatic ecosystems; impacts of thawing permafrost in the context of global warming; wetland paleoecology; restoration of vegetation in degraded sites, and research on mercury dynamics (in relation to air, precipitation, snow). An overview of past studies in this region is given in: Bhiry, N., et al., 2011: Ecoscience 18: 182-203. CEN operates several climate stations in the area. In addition to the available scientific literature, CEN has extensive climate data recorded since 1957 which are available through Nordicana D: www.cen.ulaval.ca/nordicanad/. ",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "This bicultural community represents the ancestral limit of the Cree and Inuit territories. It is both the northernmost Cree community and the southernmost Inuit community in Quebec. Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik has a population of about 1600 inhabitants. The spoken languages are Cree, Inuktitut, and English with some French. Rapid social, economic, and environmental change, initiated in the mid-20th century, continues to this day. ",
		"AccessInfo": "Whapmagoostui-Kuujjuarapik is only accessible by commercial airlines. All research activities must be planned well in advance. Local guides and translators are available for hire. Access to the surrounding area by chartered flights, boat, and ATVs can be organized by the station manager.",

During the 1990&rsquo;s it transformed into a multidisciplinary science settlement, and today stations from 10 different nations host researchers from up to 20 different countries. The area around the village is geographically diverse, including the fjord with several islands, a plateau, alluvial plains, mountains with large glaciers and extensive moraine systems, glacial rivers, coastal lagoons, and a small lake. The area further includes ornithological reserves and a nature reserve with regulated access.</p>",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "Ny-√Ölesund enjoys the mildest climate at this latitude due to a distant branch of the Gulf Stream bordering the west coast of Spitzbergen. The fauna is dominated by a large variety of birds, including arctic terns, auks, kittiwakes, gulls, barnacle geese, northern fulmars, Svalbard ptarmigans, and Arctic skuas. Mammals include Svalbard reindeer, arctic foxes, and a sporadic presence of polar bears, also seals and less frequently whales, are spotted in the fjord. The permafrost is continuous and 75-450 m thick, and the active layer thickness ranges between 0.3 and 3.8¬†m.

		"LocationInfo": "The Aktru Research Station is located in the southeastern part of the Altai Republic close to the borders to Mongolia and China in the centre of the Eurasian Continent (50¬∞06‚Äô N, 87¬∞40‚Äô¬†E). With an altitude of 2150 m a.s.l., the station is situated in the high alpine part of the Altai Mountains. The nearest settlement is Kuray village about 30 km southeast of the station. The nearest town is Gorno-Altaisk, about 250 km northwest of the station.",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "The Aktru Research Station is surrounded by a wide range of ecosystems changing with altitude: Kuray basin intermountain steppe, steppe belt on the mountain slopes, forest belt, high-mountain belt with alpine landscapes and glaciers, high-mountain tundra (‚Äúgoltsy‚Äù), as well as cryophyte steppe landscapes. A typical high-mountain vegetation is the ‚ÄúPseudo-tundra‚Äù, formed in the periphery of glacial fields under Pleistocene continental climate conditions. Some rare animal species reside in Aktru valley, e.g. snow leopards, wolverines, lynx, musk deer, mountain goats, cranes, and lama ducks. ",
		"HistoryInfo": "The Aktru Research Station was founded in 1956 by V.M. Tronov and has been in operation until today. From 1975 to 1995, a meteorological station was operated by the State Hydrometeorological Service. Since 2008 new buildings were constructed comprising a staff house, a dining room for 150 persons, a summer cafeteria for 30 persons, a diesel station, as well as showers and toilets. The older buildings, recently renovated includes a ‚Äòhospital‚Äô, classrooms, three apartments (housing c. 60 people), a warehouse, a Banya (Russian sauna), and a tent camp for 200 persons.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "The research at Aktru Research Station focuses on glaciology, hydrology, meteorology, geomorphology, ecology, botany, zoo¬≠logy, and soil science. The main aims are to study climate-driven glaciers dynamics, hydrological regimes, cryogenic processes, landscape patterns, and biota. Different international projects investigate mountain mires in terms of climate-driven changes of landscape patterns, biogeo¬≠chemistry, and productivity. Kuray Basin, an inter-mountain depression, situated at the foot of the North-Chuya Range (10 km from Aktru Station) is a key site for studying the Altai megafloods. Existing databases contain records on climate, hydrology, and glacier dynamics, as well as on plants and vegetation-cover ¬≠ecology.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "The traditional Altai‚Äôs and Kazakh‚Äôs culture still plays a major role in the daily life of the region (nomadic animal husbandry, fishing, and hunting). Also ecological tourism, alpine tourism, and research are important for the local economy.",
		"AccessInfo": "The Aktru Research Station can be reached from Kuray village (30 km of bad road, four-wheel drive vehicles are strongly recommended and can be rented in Kuray village). The nearest airports are Barnaul (650 km), Tolmachevo in Novosibirsk (880 km), and Bogashevo in Tomsk (1150 km). All these airports are connected to Moscow by daily flights.",

		"LocationInfo": "FINI comprises a growing number of monitoring sites placed on public and private land in the Faroe Islands. The 18 islands form a self-governing country under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark. The total area is approximately 1400 km2 and has a population of almost 50000 people (2010). The monitoring sites are placed on mountain slopes and summits that are accessible within an hour hike from the road and within an hour drive by car from the capital T√≥rshavn. ",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "The Faroe Islands are a group of islands situated between the Norwegian Sea and the northeast Atlantic Ocean with more than 300 km distance to the next land area (approximately half way between Scotland and Iceland). The islands have an oceanic subarctic climate and are characterised by a high relief. The mountain areas are heavily grazed by sheep. The floral and faunal biodiversity is low, reflecting the isolated location, the extreme oceanic climate, the steep topography, and intensive land use. The most dominant vegetation in the Faroe Islands is grassland, found from sea level to the mountain tops. Racomitrium heaths and fell-field vegetation dominate the alpine vegetation. Calluna heaths are common in the lowlands. Birds dominate the terrestrial wild life. ",
		"HistoryInfo": "Most of the monitoring sites of FINI are less than 10 years old. FINI has no station facilities at the sites, but can offer office facilities including internet access, other logistic support, and advice at FINI, Jar√∞feingi, in T√≥rshavn.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "The research at the FINI sites focuses on geohazards, meteorology, geophysics, and plant ecology. The existing database includes a bibliography of publications based on monitoring data.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "People in towns and villages live a modern European life. Houses are modern, the infrastructure is well developed and it is easy to travel by car. At the same time rich elements of traditional Faroese culture are deeply rooted in daily life: fishing, bird and whale hunting, traditional food and singing, and chain dancing. The language is Faroese which has close roots in the Old Norse language.",
		"AccessInfo": "You can arrive to the Faroe Islands all year by ship or by plane. The ferry leaves from Hanstholm, Denmark and Sey√∞isfj√∏r√∞ur, Iceland. Look for www.smyrilline.com. Flight connections to the Faroe Islands leave from Copenhagen (Denmark), Aalborg (Denmark), Billund (Denmark), Reykjavik (Iceland), Bergen (Norway), London (UK) and Barcelona (Spain). Look for www.atlantic.fo. The local infrastructure in the Faroe Islands is well developed with busses and ferries. It is also possible to rent cars and helicopter routes are fairly cheap.

		"LocationInfo": "The station is located on Devon Island, a Mars analog environment and polar desert, approximately 165 km northeast of the hamlet of Resolute in Nunavut, Canada (75¬∞25‚Äô N, 89¬∞49‚Äô W). The station is situated on Haynes Ridge, overlooking the Haughton impact crater, a 23 km diameter crater formed approximately 39 million years ago (late Eocene). The location is approximately 1609 km from the Geographic North Pole and approximately 1287 km from the Magnetic North Pole.",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "Because of its relatively high elevation and its extreme northern latitude, Devon Island supports only a meagre population of small birds and mammals, including muskoxen. Animal life is concentrated in the Truelove Lowland area of the island, which has a favorable microclimate and supports relatively lush arctic vegetation. Temperatures during the brief growing season seldom exceed 10 ¬∞C and in winter can plunge to as low as -50 ¬∞C. With a polar desert ecology, Devon Island receives very little precipitation. Cape Liddon is an Important Bird Area (IBA) notable for its black guillemot and northern fulmar populations. Cape Vera, another IBA site, is also noted for its northern fulmar population. Devon Island is also notable for the presence of the Haughton impact crater, created some 39 million years ago when a meteorite about 2 km in diameter crashed into what were then forests. The impact left a crater approximately 23 km in diameter, which was a lake for several million years.",
		"HistoryInfo": "The Flashline Station was built by The Mars Society in 2001, and since then it has been used to conduct planetology studies: geological, biological, and climatology studies under conditions similar to those found on Mars, and to develop field tactics based on those explorations, to test habitat design features, tools, and technologies, and to assess crew selection protocols essential to future human spaceflight. ",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Experiments at Flashline primarily focus on biodiversity surveys of the arctic desert and geological/geophysical study of the Haughton Crater area. Other experiments included a geophysical analysis of Haughton Crater which answered key questions on the physical characteristics of the 20-million year old meteor crater and examined microfossils in crater soil deposits. Logistics and engineering experiments are also conducted.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "The Mars Society invites researchers to live and work at the station, typically for one month during the arctic summer. Expeditions typically consist of a crew of between six and seven individuals. Typically 1 to 2 months prior to departing for the Canadian Arctic, the crew gathers for an initial face-to-face meeting and training session in Colorado, USA. The station‚Äôs primary mission is to help develop key knowledge needed to prepare for human Mars exploration, and to inspire the public by making real the vision of human exploration of Mars. The station is 165 km northeast of Resolute/ Qausuittuq, Nunavut, where 80% of the population is Inuit.",
		"AccessInfo": "Due to the harsh and dangerous environment of the Arctic, crew members must file an application for consideration and complete orientation and training prior to visiting the station. Crew members must travel by commercial airline to Resolute Bay, Canada. There they spend a few days organizing supplies and equipment and conducting some final training while waiting for clear weather. They then board a Twin Otter aircraft for the final leg of the journey to Devon Island. The primary means of crew transportation while on the island is by ATVs.",

		"LocationInfo": "The Greenland Institute of Natural Resources with its main buildings, laboratories, and living quarters is located in Nuuk, Greenland (64¬∞11‚Äô N, 51¬∞41‚Äô W). A small field station is situated in Kobbefjord (64¬∞08‚Äô N, 51¬∞23‚Äô W), c. 20 km southeast of Nuuk.",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "GINR and the Kobbefjord field station provide access to a low arctic ecosystem in West Greenland with different biotopes such as dwarf-shrub heaths, fens, grasslands, and lakes. Monitoring of a variety of parameters on vegetation, arthropods, mammals (both terrestrial and marine), birds, freshwater lakes, and the marine environment has been carried out at GINR for several years.",
		"HistoryInfo": "GINR was founded in 1995 (preceded by Greenland Fisheries Research; established in 1946), and the main building was inaugurated in 1998. The main building houses c. 3000 m2 of facilities necessary for the Institute‚Äôs activities, i.e. offices, laboratories, deep-freeze rooms, storage, conference room, and meeting rooms. Adjacent to the main building is an 850 m2 annex with a large multi-room used for meetings and seminars. Furthermore, the annex has five apartments and eight rooms for visiting researchers, as well as a garage/storage room. GINR has a third building near the city centre of Nuuk with furnished guest rooms for students and visiting scientists. In addition to the buildings in Nuuk, GINR owns two field stations, one in Kobbe¬≠fjord, near Nuuk, and another in Niaqornat, in the Uummannaq area, Northwest Greenland. These field stations function as bases for small research teams and accommodates four people each. GINR also owns two ships, Sanna and P√¢miut, which are used for scientific investigations in both sheltered and open waters. Also, the institute has several small boats and aluminium dinghies. For transport on land, GINR owns three cars and several snowmobiles. ",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Research and monitoring activities focus on living marine resources (fish, shellfish, marine mammals, and birds), land-based resources (land mammals and vegetation), as well as physical and chemical processes in the environment in relation to Climate Change and its impact on society. Population assessments and management advice are produced and reviewed in scientific committees under various international bodies where GINR is represented. GINR takes part in the monitoring programme Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring (www.g-e-m.dk). The objective is to provide long-term data series of the natural innate oscillations and plasticity of arctic ecosystems. This is accomplished through monitoring of selected biotic parameters and elements throughout the year on a long-term basis. Data from the monitoring is provided free of charge.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "GINR is located in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, with c. 16000 inhabitants. GINR actively communicates with users of the environment (fishermen, hunters, and recreational users) and with direct recipients of scientific advice (e.g. politicians). Users of the environment and their comprehensive knowledge of the natural environment are included during planning and implementation of the institute‚Äôs activities. Fishing and hunting is part of the traditional culture and is still practiced professionally and for recreational purposes.",
		"AccessInfo": "Nuuk can be reached by air either via Kangerlussuaq, West Greenland (www.airgreenland.com) or via Reykjavik, Iceland (www.airiceland.is). Transportation to the field station in Kobbefjord is by one of GINR‚Äôs own smaller boats carrying up to 11 persons. ",

River banks and beaches are dominated by exposed gravel/sand deposits. The altitude of the area is 0 - 40¬†m a.s.l. The terrain is snow-covered from September to June, small rivers run in depressions between the hills, but are usually dried up by the end of summer. There are no lakes, but some depressions are occupied by polygonal bogs. Permafrost is continuous. Vegetation is dominated by arctic tundra lichens, mosses, sedges, grasses, dwarf willows, and birches. More than 10 shorebird species, six waterfowl species (including the red-breasted goose), and about 10 passerine species nest in the area. Avian and terrestrial predators are represented by the snowy owl, rough-legged buzzard, peregrine falcon, three species of skuas, and arctic fox, lemmings being their basic prey. A few records of muskox and polar bear are known.",
		"HistoryInfo": "The idea of the establishment of Willem Barentsz Biological Station for the memory of the famous Arctic explorer was suggested and initiated by Prof. Evgeny Syroechkovskiy during work of the Arctic Expedition of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) in Taimyr. The building was erected in 1995 with financial support from the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature Management, and Fisheries. Monitoring and research work was initiated in1994 by RAS and since then carried out mainly as cooperation between various Russian and European researchers. The station consists of a large building with bedrooms, a storage room, a kitchen, a toilet, and a few small sheds, which can house up to 15 people. A diesel driven generator and solar power is used for energy supply, and portable diesel or kerosene stoves for heating and cooking.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "The station provides unique opportunities for complex monitoring studies aimed at assessment of the long-term dynamics of local numbers of arctic-breeding birds and their nesting success, studies of prey-predator interactions and many other aspects of population biology. Since 1998, a standardised monitoring program for breeding bird, lemming, and predator abundance, as well as nesting success in water birds has been conducted at permanent 4 km2 and 12 km2 sample plots near the station. The long-term studies carried out at the station encompass many aspects of breeding biology of birds, such as arrival and departure dates, breeding phenology, incubation schedules, variation of body condition during incubation, energy requirements and expenditure of chicks and adults, and nesting success. A number of biotic and abiotic factors, including arthropod abundance are also monitored and the vegetation of the areas mapped. Information on the peculiarities and conditions of breeding seasons, and the abundance of birds, lemmings, and predators can be found in the Arctic Bird Database maintained in the framework of the International Breeding Conditions Survey on Arctic Birds (www.arcticbirds.net). ",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "Dikson, an urban-type settlement in Taimyrskiy Dolgano-Nenetskiy District of Krasnoyarsk Kray is the nearest human settlement.

It lies about 60 km north of the continuous pine forest line and belongs to the subarctic Mountain Birch Forest Zone close to both the local pine tree line and the birch tree line at the forest-tundra ecotone. ",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "The station is close to a wide range of ecosystems from pine stands at low altitudes to mountain birch forests and low alpine tundra as well as mires (also palsas), lakes, and rivers. Several large-scale outbreaks of birch feeding moth larvae are characteristic for the birch forests. The latest outbreak in 2005-2009 destroyed about 400 km2 of the treeline birch forests in Utsjoki. Grazing by semi-domesticated reindeer is another important factor that shapes the ecosystems. The area is part of the basin of the river Teno/Tana which is one of the top salmon rivers in Europe.",
		"HistoryInfo": "The station was founded in 1958. The station, including a weather station of Finnish Meteorological Institute, consists of several buildings. It has the capacity to accommodate about 40 guests in winter and up to 70 in summertime. It is open year-round, but full-board meals will be offered only during the main field season (from May to September), except for larger groups. The station provides laboratories, a workshop, a lecture hall, and accommodation buildings. During recent years the station has had about 100 Finnish and 70 foreign visiting scientists each year.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Kevo Subarctic Research Station has got a long tradition in manipulative experiments addressing cause-effect relationships of anthropogenic environmental changes. In ecological science it is known for the research on plant herbivore interactions and in geographical science for research on palsa mires. There are long-term field experiments studying the effects of aerial pollutants and the impacts of reindeer grazing. The station has got arboretums with different origins of arctic treeline species. There is monitoring data available on population dynamics of moths, rodents, birds, plant phenology, pollen deposits, and meteorological data. The station also holds up to 50-year old bio-geographical mapping data of the surrounding area.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "Utsjoki is the only municipality in Finland with S√°mi majority for whom the traditional reindeer herding and fishing are still important livelihoods, even though it is in general a normal modern community with modern services. In Utsjoki village (18 km north of Kevo) there are grocery shops, a post office, a library, a swimming hall, accommodation providers, pubs, a bank, and a health centre. Anthropological, sociological, and archaeological studies on the local community have been managed by the research station. ",
		"AccessInfo": "The station is located close to a main road and can be reached by car. Access to the station is across Lake Kevoj√§rvi (250 m, in summer by boat and in winter over the ice) or via a small road (5 km). The closest airport in Finland is in Ivalo with a bus connection from Ivalo to Kevo (c. 150 km). There are also airports in Norway at about the same distance (Lakselv, Vads√∏, Kirkenes). Alternatively, a train connection exists from southern Finland to Rovaniemi followed by a bus trip via Ivalo to Kevo (450 km).",

		"BiodiversityInfo": "The landscape around the station is dominated by ‚ÄúFjells‚Äù (mountains or high plateaus above the tree line) extending into the Scandinavian mountain range, e.g. Fjell Saana (1029 m a.s.l.) and Pikku-Malla (738 m a.s.l.). The research station lies c.100 km north of continuous coniferous forest and belongs to the sub-alpine birch forest zone, with mountain birch being the dominant plant species. The area is dominated by a wide range of ecosystems from mountain birch forest at low altitude (480-600 m) to alpine tundra (above 600 m). The majority of the area is a mosaic of treeless alpine heath and ponds. Due to the calcareous bedrock, the Kilpisj√§rvi area is a hotspot for many calcophilic and endangered mountain plant species. As a consequence, the lepidofauna in this area is exceptionally diverse (more than 340 species are recorded). The Kilpisj√§rvi region is also famous for rich avifauna of northern and mountainous species, like the bluethroat (Luscinia svecica), the ring ouzel (Turdus torquatus), and the dotterel (Charadrius morinellus). The Norwegian lemming (Lemmus lemmus) is the most characteristic mammal species. ",
		"HistoryInfo": "The station with its four buildings was officially opened in 1964. In the main building, there are two lecture halls (with space for either 30 or 60 people, one of which also serves as dining room), computer room, library, kitchen, and laboratory facilities. Laboratories have a supply of electricity, gas, compressed air, and running water, and are equipped with refrigerator, ovens, freezers, spectrophotometer, micro- and macro-scales, microscopes, centrifuge, pH- and conductivity meters, thermometers, etc. Also a wide variety of field equipment is available, together with boats and snowmobiles.

WLAN is accessible in the station area. The accommodation capacity is about 50 persons, and meals are served daily at the station. There is a permanent staff of eight persons. ",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Widely respected long-term follow-up studies form the core of the scientific activities at the station. The longest observation series (>50 years) are on fluctuations of small rodent densities. Population dynamics of passerines have been monitored since 1957. Long-term research projects also include the periodicity in quality and quantity of vegetation in the mountain region. Effects of environmental changes have been monitored for instance in the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX). The specific long-term studies are backed by more extensive studies on climate, vegetation, soils, rodents, birds, predators, etc. Limnology is a rising branch of research. Lately research activities have extended from animal and botanical ecology to hydrobiological and paleolimnological research. Projects such as MOLAR, CHILL, LAPBIAT, and SCANNET have been carried out in Kilpisj√§rvi in addition to regular studies on geography and geophysics. The Kilpisj√§rvi Biological Station is the Finnish representative in the ITEX-project. Since 2007 the station has been part of the Finnish Northern LTSER program, in which data from long-term follow-up studies will be organised and digitized in an EU-funded LTER-project. A bibliography of publications arising from research at the station is available. There is an also an extensive collection of climate records and biological data on plants and animals available from the station. The station publishes its own newsletter ‚ÄúKilpisj√§rvi Notes‚Äù.",

With almost half a million annual visitors, it is Finland‚Äôs best known national park. ",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "Geographically, the Kolari area is located between Northern Finland, Forest Lapland and Fell Lapland, making it a very varied and interesting habitat. Kolari is situated at the western limit of the Russian taiga. The area is characterised as a mixture zone of eastern and western species of flora and fauna and includes old pine forest, wetlands, lakes, and rivers. Bears, moose, and reindeer are found in the area, the latter both as wild game and domesticated. Snow covers the landscape from November to May.",
		"HistoryInfo": "The Kolari Research Unit was established in 1964 for the study of peat lands. Today we focus on sustainable use of northern timberline forests and integration of different nature-based livelihoods also with respect to rapidly growing mining activities in this area. The station has 15 offices, high speed internet, and guestrooms for visitors. Kolari village offers various services, and a broad range of outdoor activities is possible in the nearby Yll√§s National Park.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "The research at Kolari focuses on the integration of different nature-based livelihoods at the timberline (tourism, reindeer herding, and forestry), ecologically sustainable forestry, nature protection, and plant ecology. The main objectives of the ecological projects are to study the dynamics of natural forests and disturbance dynamics of forest fires. Existing databases include a bibliography of publications arising from research at the station, as well as long term ecological data concerning timberline regeneration, rodents, seed yield, and phenology.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "The nearest community is Kolari village (five km away) with approximately 1500 inhabitants. A bit larger is the Swedish Pajala (c. 6200 inhabitants) which is located 30 km from the Kolari Research Unit.

		"BiodiversityInfo": "The Litla-Skard area exhibits birch shrubs, moss heaths, sedge mires, grassland as well as, sparsely vegetated fell fields. Also a small lake is found within the area. In total, 101 vascular plant species and 19 moss species have been recorded at the site. Birds dominate the vertebrate fauna with 22 species recorded in the area. Most notable of these are whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus), great northern divers (Gavia immer), and redwings (Turdus iliacus) in summer; snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) in winter and raven (Corvus corax) and ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) year around. Three species of mammals occur at the site: Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), American mink (Mustela vison), and wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). Two species of fish occur in the lake: three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta). ",
		"HistoryInfo": "The Litla-Skard site was designated as a bio-monitoring area in 1996. Litla-Skard is an old, lowland farm. The site is now owned by the Iceland Forest Service. In the past most of the area was used for grazing livestock, mainly sheep. The site has not been grazed since 1985. Afforestation at the site is very limited and disturbance level from human activities is low. The total land area of the Litla-Skard bio-monitoring area is 3 km2 with an elevation of 60-230 m a.s.l. At Litla-Skard there are no research buildings or laboratories, and permanent staff is not located at the site. However, accommodation and laboratory space are available at the campus of the Agricultural University of Iceland in Hvanneyri, 27 km away from the site.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Litla-Skard is a national site for the International Cooperative Program on Integrated Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Ecosystems (ICP IM). The main research emphasis till now has been on chemistry of precipitation, climate, and hydrology. A vegetation inventory has been carried out at the site, and the main vegetation and soil types have been mapped. The research is mostly confined to a 560000 m2 catchment area. Automated weather and hydrological stations were set up at the site in 2000. Existing data bases include climatic records, data on catchment hydrology and water chemistry, as well as limited biological records.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "Before the Litla-Skard area was established as a research and monitoring site in 1996, farmsteads and sheep grazing dominated the land-use. Currently there are no farms in the area and domestic grazing animals have been absent for over 20 years.",
		"AccessInfo": "Litla-Skard is reached by car throughout the year. It is located by the main central highway, c. 100 km from Reykjavik. Keflavik International Airport is situated about two hours drive from the site.",

		"LocationInfo": "The area is known for its high biodiversity in four altitudinal vegetation belts, from sub-montane to alpine. The Krkono≈°e/Karkonosze Mountains National Parks (NPs) are situated on both sides of the Czech/Poland state border and form the highest part of the Hercynian mountain system in Central Europe. The stations are situated in the tundra which covers the subalpine/alpine belt of both NPs. The mountain belt is densely occupied by mountain chalets. Nearest towns are Karpacz (PL, 8 km to the north) and Vrchlabi (CZ, 10 km to the south). ",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "The tundra ‚Äì above the Picea abies tree line ‚Äì has the unique character of a relic island of the subarctic-alpine tundra (thanks to its isolation from Scandinavia, the Alps and the Carpathians since the end of Pleistocene). Three zones are distinguishable within it: 1. ‚Äústony-lichen tundra‚Äù with a mosaic of lichens, bryophytes, low grasses, and bushes on alpine peaks, 2. ‚Äúgrassy tundra‚Äù with grasses, subarctic mires, and shrubs of Pinus mugo (vicariance of Betula nana and B. czerepanovii) in the lower plateaus, and 3. ‚Äùflower rich tundra‚Äù with tall herbs and grasses in the lee of the glacial corries. The area exhibits many plants and animal species with arctic-alpine distribution.",
		"HistoryInfo": "The Polish Karkonosze Park Narodwy was established in January 1959 and the Czech Krkono≈°e National Park in 1963. However, scientific research in this area started already in 1786. At present, 400 different scientific projects are carried out each year on both sides of the border. We can offer local accommodation, high speed internet connection and several well equipped stores in the neighbourhood.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "The research focuses on fauna, flora, lichens, bryophytes, algae, GIS, geology, geomorphology (waterfalls), environmental chemistry, climatology (avalanches), forest management, pedology, recreation, speleology, sociology (socioeconomic), former ore mining, agriculture, archaeology (history), etc. In addition, a lot of different databases containing data from animate (biotic) and inanimate (abiotic) nature are available. ",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "The Krkono≈°e/Karkonosze Mountains has been inhabited for a long time. Besides nature protection and research, the area is also used for forestry, agriculture, tourism, and sports. The Krkono≈°e/Karkonosze Mountains is a popular tourist destination for hikers and skiers with about 5-6 million visitors per year on the Czech and 2.5-3 million on the Polish side (2002).",
		"AccessInfo": "Krkono≈°e/Karkonosze Mountains can be reached by car, bus, and train. It will take around two hours by car from Prague airport to Vrchlab√≠ and another 30 min from Vrchlab√≠ to the tundra zone. Access from Poland is via Karpacz.",

In this town, more than 10 nations have their own station while using shared facilities for meals and recreation. The whole local community is focussed on science and maintenance of infrastructure. Several stations have independent terrestrial research programmes and the Netherlands‚Äô Arctic Station is the smallest of all. ",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "Kongsfjorden is a beautiful high arctic environment with several glaciers terminating in the fjord. The raised beach terraces are sparsely vegetated with dense moss cover around small tundra lakes and below bird cliffs. Locally there are clear traces of former human activity by trappers and from coal mining. At present, the whole area is well-protected and a special permission is needed to enter the islands during the bird breeding season. In 1978, reindeer was re-introduced and since 1982 barnacle geese have established a colony and are regularly feeding between the houses. Both herbivores have a clear impact on the vegetation.",
		"HistoryInfo": "From 1916 to 1968, the village of Ny-√Ölesund was a coal mining settlement. This village has now developed into a unique mix of stations, laboratories, and research infrastructure. There is a small international community of 25 to 180 people ‚Äì all temporal residents. Tourists are discouraged to stay overnight. In 1990, the University of Groningen initiated a project on barnacle geese and later joined the shared facilities with the establishment of Nether¬≠lands‚Äô Arctic Station. The station consists of two small buildings for lodging with electricity but no plumbing. Shared facilities in town offer unique high-standard science and logistic support. There is a developing cooperation with the local German/French base AWIPEV.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Research focusses on the role of barnacle geese in the arctic ecosystem. Nutrient cycles, plant productivity, and vegetation patterns are studied to understand plant-herbivore interactions. Behaviour, timing, and breeding success of individually ringed geese are observed over their lifetime, and the effect of predators is studied as a dynamic interaction. Population trends of plants, herbivores, and predators are monitored in a warming environment. Long term experiments include grazing exclosures and greenhouses on paired vegetation plots. There are also projects focussing on the history of human exploitation and the effect of tourism on cultural heritage. ",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "The local community in Ny-√Ölesund is a mixture of nationalities from the various stations. The area is owned by a company called Kings Bay, taking care of the logistics for the entire village. Ny-√Ölesund has no permanent residents and all activity is linked to science. The closest town is the Norwegian village of Longyearbyen, which is the main hub of Svalbard. In Longyearbyen, permanent residents are few (c. 2100). There are no indigenous people and most inhabitants originate from the Norwegian mainland and live on Svalbard only because of their temporal job assignment. Tourism, local administration, science, and coal mining are the most important sources of income.",
		"AccessInfo": "Throughout the year, Kings Bay organises two flights per week with a small plane (14 passengers) between Longyearbyen and Ny-√Ölesund. In summer, there are about 30000 tourists landing by boat for just a few hours. There is only a limited amount of roads near the village. Local transportation is possible by car, bicycle, snowmobile, or foot. Small boats are used for transportation inside the fjord. ",

		"LocationInfo": "PEARL is located adjacent to the Environment Canada Weather Station at Eureka, Nunavut, Canada. PEARL operates three facilities: (i) The PEARL Ridge Laboratory (80¬∞03‚Äô N, 86¬∞24‚Äô W, 610 m a.s.l.), (ii) the Zero-Altitude PEARL Auxiliary Laboratory (0PAL) (79¬∞59‚Äô N, 85¬∞56‚Äô W, 10 m a.s.l.), and (iii) the Surface and Atmospheric Flux, Irradiance, Radiation Extension Site (SAFIRE) (79¬∞59‚Äô N, 85¬∞48‚Äô W, 73 m a.s.l.). The area is a land reserve of the Federal government under Environment Canada. The station is situated on the shores of Slidre Fjord. There is no local permanent settlement in the area.",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "The area around PEARL is an arctic desert. The whole area is underlain by permafrost which is exposed in places. The micro-climate is exceptionally mild for this latitude (maximum temperature: 20 ¬∞C, minimum temperature: -55 ¬∞C). Wildlife includes wolves, muskox, arctic fox, and some caribou as well as migratory birds.",
		"HistoryInfo": "The Weather Station at the site has operated for over 60 years. The first research building was constructed in the early 1990s, and PEARL itself was inaugurated in 2006. The laboratories provide housing, facilities for atmospheric (and other) research, instruments, and workshops for maintenance and repair the instruments. Currently there are about 25 instruments operating at the site. Telephone and internet (via geostationary satellite) are available, but with limited bandwidth due to cost. The facility can accommodate 20-40 people at any time of the year.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "The major emphasis at PEARL is on atmospheric research. The original purpose of the installation was to monitor stratospheric ozone, and although that work is still ongoing, the research has now broadened in scope to encompass the entire atmosphere and beyond. Current measurements include ozone and associated chemicals in the stratosphere as well as the troposphere, aerosols and particulates, radiation and fluxes and upper atmo¬≠sphere temperatures, winds, and waves. Other research groups including biologists, astronomers, and geologists regularly make use of the nearby Eureka Weather Station as a base. Measurements are regularly submitted to the NDACC, TCCON, and AeroNet databases.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "There is no local community. The nearest permanent facilities are the military base at Alert on the north side of Ellesmere Island and the community of Grise Fjord in southern Ellesmere Island. Both of these are about 450 km from PEARL.",
		"AccessInfo": "Access to the station is by chartered aircraft only, but the site can be accessed at any time of the year. Charter flights can be organised from Iqaluit, Resolute Bay, and Yellowknife. There is an annual sea-lift for bringing in larger equipment and goods. Transport around the site is by 4√ó4 truck. Many of the instruments on the site are adapted for automatic or semi-automatic operation to reduce the need for on-site support.",

		"BiodiversityInfo": "Pristine environment surrounds the station, where glaciers, mountains, valleys, lakes, and rivers are not affected by humans. In 2002, the Polish station, together with the Hornsund Fjord, was recognized as one of six the European Marine Biodiversity Flagship Sites (www.iopan.gda.pl/projects/biodaff). Tundra with many species of lichens, mosses, flowers, and shrubs occupy the raised marine terraces and the lower parts of the mountain slopes. Reindeers, Arctic foxes, and polar bears together with many bird species are living around the station.",
		"HistoryInfo": "The Polish Polar Station was established in 1957, as a winter base during the 3rd International Geophysical Year 1957/1958. In the 1970s, it was used by Polish research expeditions during summers only. The station was renovated in 1978 and has been in operation year-round since then. Today, the station is a modern research platform with access to well-equipped laboratories, satellite communication, and internet. Accommodation, washing, and cooking facilities for 20 visitors (in addition to the permanent staff of 10 persons) are in the same building. There is also a well equipped workshop, a boat house, and storage for instruments and field equipment. The station lounge has a multimedia projector, white screen, and a 60‚Äù HD LCD TV and is used for scientific seminars and conferences for up to 20-30 participants.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "The research at the Polish Polar Station focuses on meteorology, glaciology, monitoring of geophysical fields (i.e. seismology, geomagnetism, atmospherical electricity), permafrost, and geomorphic processes. The main study objectives are related to the evolution of the high arctic environment with respect to Climate Change. Projects include the research on mass and energy balance of glaciers, fluctuations and changes of their hydrothermal state, and dynamics of tidewater glaciers and their interaction with the ocean. Changes in marine and terrestrial ecosystems are systematically studied, including a strong ornithological component. Existing databases include meteorological and glaciological records (www.glacio-topoclim.org), geophysical data (collected in several world data centres), as well as marine and terrestrial biological parameters. There is a bibliography of publications arising from research at the station.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "The closest town Longyearbyen is administrative center and the largest settlement of Svalbard with more than 2100 inhabitants. There are harbours and airport with regular flight connections with Troms√∏ and Oslo. In the town are also hotels, restaurants, shops, galleries, hospital, school, and the University Center of Svalbard (UNIS) with c. 350 students and 40 persons in the staff. Longyearbyen is also the seat of the Norwegian Governor of Svalbard with police station and helicopter rescue station as well.",
		"AccessInfo": "There are no roads between any settlement and the Polish Polar Station. During the summer season, the station can be reached by ships or yachts. Flights by helicopter may be used all year-round. The trip by ship from Longyearbyen to Hornsund takes 12-24 hours and by helicopter c. 1 hour. In winter and spring, Hornsund can be reached by snowmobiles, if two fjords between Longyearbyen and the station have stable and thick enough sea ice cover.",

		"LocationInfo": "The station is located at 65¬∞40‚Äô N and 38¬∞10‚Äô W in southeast Greenland, about 20 km north of the small town Tasiilaq (Ammassalik). The station is situated on the shore of the Sermilik Fjord on the west side of Ammassalik Island adjacent to the Mittivakkat Glacier, a local small ice cap.",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "The research area is situated in the low arctic coastal vegetation zone, and demonstrates a large flora diversity. It is dominated by dwarf-shrub heaths, snow-bed communities, and open fell-field communities. Fens, herb slopes, and copses are present but are only found in smaller niches in the alpine dominated landscape.",
		"HistoryInfo": "During an expedition in 1933, led by the famous polar researcher Knud Rasmussen, the first surveys of glaciers and geomorphology were carried out on Ammassalik Island and at the Mittivakkat Glacier. In 1970 a permanent field station, the Sermilik Research Station, was established, to provide a logistic base for the ongoing glaciological, hydrological, and geomorphological investigations of the Mittivakkat Glacier and its catchment. In 1993, an automatic meteorological station was established at a nunatak situated close to the equilibrium line of the Mittivakkat Glacier to study the glacier climate (515 m a.s.l.). In 1997, a second meteorological station was established, to study the climate in the coastal region. A third meterological station was established at about 200 m a.s.l. in 2009, comprising data on short wave incoming radiation, temperature, relative humidity, wind (direction and speed), and precipitation. The main building of the station is an insulated wooden house of 60 m2 with three rooms for scientists, a dining room, a living room, a kitchen, a toilet, and a storage room. A second, non-insulated building of 50 m2 holds workshop, equipment, generator, a rubber boat, as well as optional accommodation for four persons in a separate room. The station buildings allow for accommodation of 6-10 researchers. During student summer field courses a tent camp is established at the station.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "The station supports a comprehensive year-round monitoring programme covering basic climatology and local climate gradients in the Mittivakkat Glacier drainage basin, glacier mass balance, run-off and sediment transport, and the development of coastal and delta geomorphology. Data are available on request from the three climate stations and a hydrometric station. Glacier mass-balance measurements and glacier surveys has been carried out since the mid 1980s and delta surveys since 1989. Maps, digital 3D terrain models, satellite data, and aerial photographs, in addition to a complete bibliography of publications arising from research at the Sermilik Research Station are available on request. ",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "More than half of the population of East Greenland (c. 3000 inhabitants) live in the town Tasiilaq (c. 1700 inhabitants) which is located 20 km south of the research station. Even though the traditional Inuit culture still plays a major role in daily life, Tasiilaq is also a modern community. Fishing, hunting, service industries, and tourism are the major businesses in the town. The Ammassalik Island and the valleys behind the town have a unique flora and are popular places for hiking.",
		"AccessInfo": "The Sermilik Research Station can be reached by commercial air carrier via Island to Kulusuk Airport (Greenland Air or charter flights) followed by a helicopter flight to Tasiilaq. From Tasiilaq to the station a boat or a helicopter charter is recommended depending on the weather, snow, or ice conditions, and the amount of luggage/cargo. It is also possible to reach the station after a 15-20 km hike. It is highly recommended to book favourable air tickets half a year in advance and to plan at least two travel days to reach Sermilik Station from Europe.",

		"LocationInfo": "Sonnblick Observatory is located in the Austrian Central Alps at an elevation of 3100 m a.s.l. It is situated at the alpine main divide, which is a clear climatological border. It also lies in the ‚ÄúNationalpark Hohe Tauern‚Äù which covers 1856 km2 of the Austrian Alps at the border between the provinces of Salzburg, Carinthia, and Tyrol. Nearest villages are Heiligenblut to the South (10 km away) and Rauris to the North (20 km away). One important reason for the establishment of the Sonnblick Observatory in 1886 was the available infrastructure from gold mining activities. ",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "The natural environment is high-alpine with year-round snow-cover, glaciers, and permafrost. Sonnblick region covers mountain ecosystems. ",
		"HistoryInfo": "Sonnblick Observatory was built in 1886 at the summit of Sonnblick Mountain, motivated from the need for information on meteorology in higher altitudes of the atmosphere. Very soon other scientific disciplines became interested in the extreme location of the observatory, e.g. Nobel-prize winner V.F. Hess for his measurements of cosmic rays. In 1986, the observatory was rebuilt to a modern observatory with cable car access, electricity, and a large research platform. From that time onwards investigations on atmospheric chemistry became a new research field at Sonnblick. Today, Sonnblick is a station of interdisciplinary research covering the atmosphere, the cryosphere, the biosphere, the lithosphere, and the hydrosphere. ",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Research of Sonnblick is currently formulated in the research programme ENVISON. It covers three main topics (the atmo¬≠sphere, the cryosphere, and the biosphere) in an extensive monitoring programme and with many research projects. Sonnblick is outstanding with respect to its long-term climate observations and studies on glacier changes. Thus, the impact of Climate Change on the cryosphere is a major research topic at Sonnblick. Since 1886, Sonnblick was also involved in many international projects on atmospheric chemistry and atmo¬≠spheric physics. The research is described on www.sonnblick.net. Sonnblick Observatory cooperates with several Austrian and international universities/research institutions. Within the frame of the GAW-DACH cooperation, Sonnblick has a special partnership with the observatories Jungfraujoch (in Switzerland), Zugspitze and Hohenpeissenberg (both Germany) for common research on atmospheric processes and Climate Change (GAW: Global Atmosphere Watch in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland: D-A-CH).",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "The nearest settlements are Rauris (c. 30 inhabitants) in the North and Heiligenblut, at the foot of Austria‚Äôs highest peak Gro√üglockner (3798 m), in the South. Both villages are well known tourist centres for mountain-related summer and winter activities (all kind of skiing, hiking, climbing, cycling, etc.). The Valley of Rauris is the largest community of the Salzburg province, and has more than 420000 bed-nights related to tourism per year. Heiligenblut has 1090 inhabitants (January 2011) and is the end point of the Gro√üglocker Hochalpenstra√üe (high alpine road).",
		"AccessInfo": "Access to Sonnblick Observatory is possible throughout the year either by cable car from the North (20 minutes trip from Rauris valley) or by hiking from Rauris valley from the north or from Heiligenblut from the south (about 5 hours hike from both sides). As Sonnblick is situated within the ‚ÄúNationalpark Hohe Tauern‚Äù the use of helicopters is restricted. However, scientific activities usually will get permission for required helicopter flights. Because of its remote location in the Alps potential mountain hazards have to be considered during field work. Sonnblick Observatory is built together with an alpine hut ‚ÄúZittelhaus‚Äù which offers additional accommodation and space.",

The Lena River Delta is the largest delta system in the Arctic and Samoylov Island is part of the Lena Delta Reserve, the largest protected area in Russia. The nearest settlement is Tiksi, located about 115 km to the South-East, and home to c. 5000 inhabitants.",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "Samoylov Island is situated in the youngest part of the Lena Delta in the zone of continuous permafrost. It covers an area of about 5¬†km2 and is dominated by wet polygonal tundra, characterised by low-centered ice-wedge polygons. The regional arctic-continental climate allows maximum thaw depths of about 0.5 m. Hydrophytic sedges such as Carex aquatilis, Carex chordorrhiza, and Carex rariflora, as well as mosses (e.g. Drepanocladus revolvens, Meesia triquetra, and Aulacomnium turgidum) dominate the vegetation in the wet polygon centers and on their edges. Mesophytic dwarf shrubs such as Dryas octopetala and Salix glauca, forbs (Astragalus frigidus), and mosses (Hylocomium splendens, Timmia austriaca) dominate the polygon rims.",
		"HistoryInfo": "The old wooden station was originally built as a logistics base for the Lena Delta Reserve. After its extension in 2005, it became an official Russian-German research station (in 2006), owned and run by the Lena Delta Reserve (Russia) and the Alfred Wegener Institute. In 2013, a new large modern Russian station, owned and run by the Trofimuk Institute of Petroleum, was officially opened. It replaces the old wooden station, which is, however, still used during the busiest field seasons in summer for additional accommodation and working space. The new station can accommodate up to 25 people year-round. The station building consists of three wings, which include the living areas, scientific laboratories equipped with numerous high-precision instruments, and workshop and storage facilities, respectively. The central part includes kitchen and dining room, conference hall, and recreation areas.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "The Lena Delta is a key area for studies of the dynamics and development of permafrost in the Siberian Arctic. The research focuses on the ecosystem-atmosphere interactions on various spatial and temporal scales in order to assess and predict climate environmental changes in the Lena River Delta region. The main objectives are to study the community, structure, and dynamics of microbial populations involved in the methane cycle as well as the processes controlling exchange of methane, carbon dioxide, and energy on diff erent scales. Other important long-term studies focus on climate and permafrost monitoring, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, river hydrology, geomorphology, permafrost dynamics, arctic coastal dynamics, and hydrobiology (e.g. zooplankton dynamics). For more information see Hubberten, H.-W. et al. 2003 (published 2006): Polarforschung 73, 111-116 and Boike, J. et al. 2013: Biogeosciences 10, 2105-2128.Data and results from Samoylov can be found in the PANGAEA database (www.pangaea.de).",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "The human infl uence on the Lena Delta is minimal due to its status as a nature reserve with three rangers living in the reserve throughout most of the year. However, there is some subsistence fishing in the summer, and occasionally river cruise ships pass by.",
		"AccessInfo": "The Research Station Samoylov Island can be reached from Tiksi (connected by regular air service to Moscow and Yakutsk) by helicopter in about 45 minutes and by river boat in about 12hours. Winter transport is also possible by truck or tank on the ice of the Lena River.",

The immediate surroundings of the HEF are characterized by freshly exposed rocks and debris resulting from ongoing glacial retreat. Huge Little Ice Age moraines dominate the surroundings of the glacier tongue. Due to its high elevation and somehow difficult access, SH is not suitable for studying the lower parts of the Rofen Valley. Main focus is on glaciology and atmospheric studies.",
		"HistoryInfo": "HEF is mentioned in 1601 for the first time and then in 1678, 1774, 1770, 1816 in the context of pro-glacial lake formation and related glacial lake outburst floods. Glacier extent observations began in 1847, and the earliest maps are from 1870, 1888, and 1893, followed by a long series of maps. Research was intensified since the International Geophysical Year and during the International Hydrologica Decade/Program of UNESCI/IHP. HEF has been the key research site for glaciological studies at IMGI ever since. In 1966, SH was built to logistically support the ongoing scientific activities. It accommodates up to eight persons in bunk beds. There is no electricity but gas for cooking, heating, and light.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "HEF has one of the longest time series on glacier mass balance for any glaciers on Earth, based on series of geodetic maps starting in the 19th century. Since 2001 1-2 airborne LIDAR surveys are carried out per year for determining ice volume changes. Length changes have been measured annually since 1847, and a mass balance time series dates back to 1953. Complementary studies of ice-atmopshere interactions, ice dynamics, and glacier hydrology has accumulated rich data sets.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "The nearest settlements are Vent in Austria, 15 km from SH (150 permanent inhabitants, alpine farming and tourism) and Kurzras/Maso Corto and Schnals/Senales in Italy (approximately 10 permanent inhabitants, year-round glacier ski tourism).",
		"AccessInfo": "SH is accessed from Innsbruck Airport either by car (2 hours) or train/bus (4 hours) to Vent. From there, it is a 5-6 hours walk to the station. (The Hochjoch Hospiz mountain hut is half way). Helicopter transport is also possible but expensive.",

		"LocationInfo": "Summit Station (72¬∞36‚Äô N, 38¬∞25‚Äô W), is a research platform locat¬≠ed near the summit of the Greenland ice sheet at an altitude of 3210 m a.s.l. It is located within Greenland‚Äôs North-East National Park which protects the inland ice and glaciers issuing therefrom as well as adjoining coastal land areas. ",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "Located near the summit of the Greenland ice sheet, Summit Station‚Äôs\r\nlocation features ease of access to a high elevation, high latitude and low water vapor location that allows researchers to measure components of the earth system that would otherwise not be accessible. The facility is currently the highest elevation research station located north of the Arctic Circle. ",
		"HistoryInfo": "Summit Station began as the base camp for the drilling of the GISP2 ice core in 1989. Since then, the station has hosted both summer campaign science and, since 1997, year-round monitor¬≠ing observations of cryospheric processes, both chemical and physical. After the initial ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù winter seasons in 1997-98 and 2000-2002, the station has been continuously occupied since 2003. The station consists of three primary structures, with tem¬≠porary shelters erected seasonally. It serves a seasonal population of up to 50 staff and researchers during the months of April-Au¬≠gust, with a skeleton staff of 5 for the remainder of the year.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "A wide variety of research projects have been conducted at Sum¬≠mit since 1989. Initially established as a ‚Äòcamp‚Äô for the collection of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project II (GISP2) ice core, seasonal campaigns were established to measure atmospheric com¬≠ponents to improve the interpretation of the ice core records. The value of the location was readily recognised and further intensive measurement campaigns were initiated on a seasonal basis. Since that time Summit Station has become an Arctic ‚Äòflag¬≠ship‚Äô station as part of the Arctic Observing Network (AON) and the International Arctic Systems for Observing the Atmosphere (IASOA) network. The Greenland Environmental Observatory at Summit (GEOSummit) was established in response to a demand for a facility capable of providing year-round resources and support for research on the summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Project summaries, a list of publications and contacts by which to access Summit-derived datasets can be found at the GEO¬≠Summit website www.geosummit.org.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "The nearest local community of Ilulissat is 593 km west of Sum¬≠mit with approximately 4500 inhabitants of Greenlandic descent. Summit Station cooperates with other field stations in the area such as the Danish East Greenland Ice Core Project (EGRIP) and many international research institutes. ",
		"AccessInfo": "Access is provided via Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, on Hercules LC-130 aircraft operated by the New York Air National Guard 109th Airlift Wing (NYANG-109) and/or ski-equipped Twin Otter flights operated by Norland Air that utilize a 4877 m groomed ‚Äúski-way‚Äù for on-site flight operations. The station can also be accessed over¬≠land but not typically used as means of general transportation. The Greenland Inland Traverse (GrIT) follows a roughly 1200 km route from the Thule Air Base, carrying fuel and cargo that reduces the use of aircraft. This also reduces cost to the program and aircraft emissions at Summit Station, a clean air/clean snow research site.",

		"LocationInfo": "The Sverdrup Research Station is located in the research village Ny-√Ölesund on the northern side of Br√∏gger Peninsula at the southern shore of Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. The infrastructure in Ny-√Ölesund is run by the Kings Bay Company. The town hosts many national research stations, and the Sverdrup Research Station is the main Norwegian station in Ny-√Ölesund. The nearest civilian settlement is Longyearbyen, 100 km south of Ny-√Ölesund.",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "Ny-√Ölesund is surrounded by arctic tundra and river plains, while the mountains in the inner part of the Br√∏gger Peninsula have many small glaciers. Large glacier tongues flow into ¬≠Kongs¬≠fjorden on the eastern and northern side of the fjord. Most of the birds living in Svalbard are breeding on small islands or on bird cliffs in Kongsfjorden. Reindeer and foxes are common visitors in Ny-√Ölesund. Seals are often seen close to the settlement, and sometimes also walrus and beluga occur.",
		"HistoryInfo": "Ny-√Ölesund was a mining town until the 1960s. After the mining was stopped, Ny-√Ölesund started to develop into a research town, beginning with the Norwegian Polar Institute establishment of a permanent research station in 1968. Today, 10 nations have stations in Ny-√Ölesund, and scientists from many more nations visit Ny-√Ölesund to conduct research. The Sverdrup Research Station hosts Norwegian projects and research groups from nations without their own station in Ny-√Ölesund. The station provides logistical support (snowmobiles, boats, and equipment), workshops, office facilities, and field storage, while laboratory space is available through the Kings Bay Marine Laboratory. One of the main activities of the Norwegian Polar Institute is to run the Zeppelin Observatory (which is on top of the Zeppelin Mountain (475 m a.s.l.) and accessible by cable car) for long-term atmospheric monitoring. Up to 25 people can be accommodated at Sverdrup Station in the summer peak season.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Ny-√Ölesund and its area is ideal for research and monitoring of contemporary environmental changes related to Climate Change issues, long range transport of pollutants, UV-radiation and related biological effects, physiology, eco-toxicology, arctic marine and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as other research disciplines. To release the full potential of the various activities from the 10 research stations in Ny-√Ölesund, the stations have implemented four flagship programmes focusing on marine, terrestrial, atmospheric, and glaciological research. ",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "The research village Ny-√Ölesund is in general only accessible for researchers. During the peak season (July-August), 150-180 persons stay in Ny-√Ölesund, but the number drops drastically to 40-60 people in spring and autumn. Only the permanent staff (30-40 people) is present during the winter months. Today, Ny-√Ölesund includes Svalbard‚Äôs largest collection of automatically protected cultural monuments and is one of the archipelago‚Äôs highly prioritised cultural environments.",
		"AccessInfo": "Longyearbyen can be reached by commercial aircrafts. From there an air shuttle service twice a week connects Longyearbyen with Ny-√Ölesund. The flight takes c. 25 minutes with 14-17 persons per flight. A limited number of researchers arrive by ship, but there is no regular ship transport to Ny-√Ölesund, except one monthly freight ship during the summer.",

		"BiodiversityInfo": "TFS is situated in the arctic foothills province of the North Slope, which is characterised by rolling hills and broad valleys underlain by continuous permafrost. The area is dotted with lakes, and the vegetation is dominated by dwarf-shrub and tussock tundra. Caribou and Arctic ground squirrels are frequently observed at the field station, and moose, musk-oxen, and grizzly bears are encountered occasionally.",
		"HistoryInfo": "TFS was first established in 1975 to support an aquatic research program. The field station evolved from a 10-person tent camp into a premier arctic research laboratory and science support facility capable of supporting up to 150 researchers. The field station includes several laboratory trailers and tents, a lecture hall, various dormitory accommodation styles, a kitchen and dining hall, shower and laundry facilities, and a tool shop. TFS is open year-round and provides transportation to and from the station, basic science support, high-speed internet, GIS services, general-use laboratory and field equipment, herbarium, and baseline environmental and meteorological data.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Research themes at TFS are wide-ranging and dynamic and currently include the structure and function of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of the arctic foothills and tundra, the effects of Climate Change in these regions, and the feedbacks to global Climate Change through gas and hydrological fluxes. TFS-based research has also led to significant discoveries on the adaptations of plants and animals to the Arctic and to population-level changes in phenologies and distributions.

		"BiodiversityInfo": "Due to the severe continental climate, the environmental conditions in the region are comparable with the subarctic zone of Northern Europe. The research site is representative for the Western Siberian pristine carbon accumulating peatland ecosystem (‚Äúplain mires‚Äù). The mires cover c. 60 % of the land surface and can be regarded as important sources/sinks of greenhouse gases and aerosols. The main mire type of the site is raised bogs of the type ‚ÄúPine-dwarf shrubs-bogs‚Äù (‚Äúryam‚Äù) characterised by pine trees, Ledum palustre and dwarf shrubs, with areas of Sphagnum fuscum. Interspersed are mires of the type ‚Äúpoor fens‚Äù (partly drained in the summer) dominated by Carex lasiocarpa and other graminoids, and Sphagnum balticum. Also ridge-hollow complexes, consisting of bog ridges and poor fen hollows are present. The (avi-) fauna includes many species typical for the peatland and extensive river floodplains near the station and of the relatively dry mixed forests between the peatlands and the floodplains.",
		"HistoryInfo": "The Mukhrino Field Station was opened in 2009. It is a two-storey wooden building with study/laboratory rooms, beds for 14 persons, a simple dining room with kitchen, and a Russian sauna. The experimental field is equipped with 1 km long walking boards, which cross the main mire ecosystem types and facilitate researcher‚Äôs access to perform experiments and measurements in and above the mires, without disturbing the ecosystems. In the centre of the field site, an equipment shelter has been built. Distributed across the field site are clusters of thermologgers, water level recorders, and nine semi-automatic chambers (1 m2) and an Eddy Covarians measuring station for measuring greenhouse gas fluxes.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "The Mukhrino Field Station was primarily established for studies of the biodiversity (fauna, vegetation, mycology) and hydrology of the mire ecosystems, of the carbon storage in the peat layers, and for measurements of greenhouse gas fluxes to and from the pristine peatland complex, located next to the field station. The station is also used for analyses of Climate Change effects in peatland ecosystems and carbon balance, and the spatial comparison of key areas in S-N transects (57-67¬∞ N) as an analogue for Climate Change over time. The station houses specialists in vegetation science, remote sensing, mycology, hydrology, and greenhouse gas emission measurements. The Mukhrino Field Station welcomes foreign and national guests for collaboration, research, and educational purposes.",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "Near the Mukhrino Field Station, a limited number of local people, mostly from Khanty-Mansiysk town, can be met while fishing in the rivers and lakes. Hunting is mainly a winter activity using snowmobiles. The wider area is part of oil/gas concession area, but no activities are expected near the station for this decade. ",
		"AccessInfo": "The Mukhrino Field Station is accessible from Khanty-Mansiysk by road (first 20 km) and then either by boat (in spring and early summer only), by foot (7 km, in late summer), or by snowmobile (in winter and spring). Khanty-Mansiysk has an international airport with daily connections to Moscow.",

		"LocationInfo": "VRS is located on Princess Ingeborgs Peninsula (c. 20 √ó15 km2 lowland plain) at the military facility, Station Nord, in North Greenland (81¬∞36‚Äô N, 16¬∞39 W). The station is situated within the National Park of North and Northeast Greenland, the largest national park in the World. The military station has an average elevation of 30 m a.s.l. with a gentle slope to the coast. A 2 km gravel/ice runway, which is kept open year round, is the only gateway to Station Nord. The station acts as a gateway to the northern part of the National Park of North and Northeast Greenland. ",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "The station is situated in the High Arctic, and the surroundings are mainly Polar Desert. The area has continuous permafrost, and a continuous snow cover characterise the area for almost ten month per year. The mean annual temperature is c. -17 ¬∞C and the mean annual precipitation is c. 190 mm. Mean monthly temperature is -31 ¬∞C during the coldest month (February) and 3 ¬∞C during the warmest month (July). The Princess Ingeborgs Peninsula plain consists of Quaternary raised marine silt, beach shingle, and glacial deposits. The Quaternary deposits are underlain by rocks of Permian age. Station Nord is situated very close to the Polar Sea, and the sea-ice conditions in the area are generally severe with heavy sea-ice throughout the year. Consequently, ships cannot service Station Nord. Provide access to another Greenland with unique arctic ecosystems including species like ivory ant geese, whales, and muskox.",
		"HistoryInfo": "Station Nord was opened in 1952 as a Danish weather station and emergency runway, and it remained open until 1972, when it was closed and left unused, until the Danish military acquired it in 1975. The research activities at Station Nord have been ongoing since the 1970s with measurement activities being intensified since 1990. The research facilities were established by the Danish National Environmental Research Institute (NERI), which is now merged with Aarhus University. In 2014, the research facilities at Station Nord were substantially upgraded based on a major grant from the Danish private fund, Villum Foundation. VRS now consists of three buildings, including a main building with laboratories and accommodation facilities, an atmospheric/air observatory situated two km outside Station Nord, and a garage with storage facilities. The station can house 14 scientists at a time. The total area under roof is c. 600 m2.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Once the new station is fully operating, a database will be established for storage of all kind of scientific data. At present only atmospheric data are stored in a database maintained by Aarhus University. Meteorological and atmospheric chemical data are reported to EMEP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme), and AMAP (Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme) and will in the future also be reported to WMO-GAW (World Meteorological Organisation, Global Atmosphere Watch). A list of the parameters currently being measured at Station Nord can be found on http://envs.au.dk/en/research/facilities/villumresearchstation. ",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "Station Nord is operated by the Danish military and is manned year round by five soldiers. The nearest Inuit community is situated more than 800 km away. ",
		"AccessInfo": "Traditionally, transport to Station Nord has been with the Danish Air Force Hercules C-130 aircrafts on space-available conditions. From 2015, Aarhus University will arrange weekly flights between Longyearbyen, Svalbard, and Station Nord.",

Below it, old-growth pine forests with some open mires and spruce swamps are the main vegetation types. Open dry tundra heath lies above the tree line. The climate is sub-continental with an annual mean air temperature of -0.5¬∞C and an annual precipitation of 600 mm. There are several rare northern and eastern species nesting in the nature reserve, e.g. dotterel (Charadrius morinellus) and red-flanked bluetail (Tarsiger cyanurus).",
		"HistoryInfo": "The station was established in 1967 when the first 50 m2 log cabin was built in the middle of the wilderness. Later on, the station has been extended, and currently it can accommodate c. 20 researchers indoors and more outdoors in tents. There are small but efficient working facilities for indoor research work including e.g. wireless network, workstations, and reference library. The station is connected to the main electricity network but has also a generator for exceptional cases. The station staff on duty every day, year around. The nearest commercial facilities, such as grocery store and healthcare centre, are located 100 km away in the village of Savukoski. ",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "The research focuses on interactions between the subarctic ecosystems and the atmosphere. The core is at the SMEAR I (Station for Measuring Ecosystem Atmosphere Relations) station at the Kotovaara hill (800 m from the station). Since early 1990‚Äôs, continuous measurements on tree gas exchange (photosynthesis, transpiration), soil respiration, tree growth, weather, gas, and aerosol concentrations and fluxes, and pollutant transport have been performed. The measurements are online and maintained throughout the year. The data are stored in an open database. In addition, several long (over 40 years) observation series on e.g. snow conditions, nesting birds, and phenology, as well as shorter term campaigns, on e.g. forest fire regimes and tree regeneration, exist in the station data repositories. ",
		"HumanDimensionInfo": "The nearest local village is Savukoski, c. 100 km to the southwest. The forests are used intensively for forestry and reindeer husbandry. The nearby Urho Kekkonen National Park and other protected areas as well as fish-rich rivers fascinate large numbers of tourists. Recently, plans have been proposed for opening a large open pit phosphorus mine and a concentration plant in the close vicinity of V√§rri√∂ Strict Nature Reserve. ",
		"AccessInfo": "The station is accessed by foot (during summer) or by ski (during winter), assistance with snowmobile or a quad bike is available for instruments and larger luggage. The walking distance from the nearest unpaved road to the station is about 7 km. The distance to the nearest airport (Rovaniemi) is c. 300 km, while the nearest railway station (Kemij√§rvi) is c. 190 km away.

The station is situated in the southern part of the National Park of North and East Greenland, the largest national park in the world (approximately 1 million km2). The nearest settlement is the military outpost Daneborg (with a marine research facility) 25 km southeast of the station. The nearest town is Ittoqqortoormiit, 450 km south of the station.",
		"BiodiversityInfo": "Zackenberg Research Station is situated in the High Arctic in an area with continuous permafrost. The study area comprises the drainage basin of the river Zackenbergelven, with a total size of c. 500 km2. A great variety of biotopes like ponds, fens, heaths, fell field plateaus and grasslands occur within the core study area. Muskoxen, lemming, Arctic fox, and Arctic hare are among the common mammals in the area, while polar bear and Arctic wolf are occasional visitors.",
		"HistoryInfo": "In 1974, a national park was established in Northeast Greenland, which became a UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserve in 1977. In 1991, the first expedition under the research programme Zackenberg Ecological Research Operations was made to Zackenberg. In 1995, a temporary field station was established, and in 1997 Zackenberg Research Station was officially opened. Each year, the station is manned from 1 May to 31 October. In the remaining part of the year, the station is only in use if needed. The station has 25 beds, two laboratories, a workshop, a mess with cook, and satellite-based telephone, fax, and email service. An accommodation and laboratory facility is located next to the military outpost Daneborg. This facility accommodates 10 scientists.",
		"GeneralResearchInfo": "Zackenberg Research Station provides facilities for specific but comprehensive research projects and for an extensive long-term research/ monitoring programme, called Zackenberg Basic. Zackenberg Basic consists of five sub-programmes: ClimateBasis (monitoring the climate), GeoBasis (monitoring the carbon balance of the ecosystem, other feedbacks to Climate Change, and physical landscape processes), BioBasis (monitoring the living nature), MarineBasis (monitoring physical and biological processes in the marine ecosystem), and GlacioBasis (monitoring the mass balance of local glaciers). At the station, there are approximately 25 ongoing projects per year, of which about two third focus on Climate Change feedbacks. Results from the research and monitoring at Zackenberg are reported in the ZERO Annual Reports published by Aarhus University. PDF-versions of the annual reports are available at www.zackenberg.dk. The database of the Zackenberg Basic monitoring is available for direct access through the internet at data.g-e-m.dk. This homepage also holds the manuals for the different monitoring sub-programmes.
